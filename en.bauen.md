### Introduction

This is a story that does not have an end yet. The BAUEN hotel is possibly one of the best-known experiences of labor self-management in the world, a symbol of the ability of the workers to not only manage a company, but to take their fate into their own hands. It does not have an end because this end is still open. As this book went to press, a new eviction order against the cooperative, issued by judge Paula María Hualde, was pending on the hotel. Earlier, December 26, 2016, President Mauricio Macri had vetoed the expropriation law that, after fourteen years of struggle, workers had finally had  approved by both houses of Congress, in two anguishing sessions separated by almost a year of waiting. That Presidential veto set up the situation in which this book came to be.

The immediate result of this highly complex situation, perhaps the most difficult the members of the cooperative have been through in a history that has not lacked for difficult moments, is not going to substantially modify what is told here, which is the long struggle of a group of workers who have written several pages in the rich history of the Argentine' workers movement. They have become a point of reference for self-management, for our country, for France, Greece, or Mexico. The story of the BAUEN has points of similarity with that of other recovered businesses, but also several differences that should be highlighted. They, like most of the protagonists of the approximately 370 businesses recovered by workers in Argentina, have been through anguishing moments, times of struggle and resistance, but also of happiness, collective construction, creativity, and solidarity. But the difference is an obsession with putting an end to this cooperative, especially among economic and judicial powers, who join with the unmediated political power of the Cambiemos Alliance in the current government. So, the crux of this book is not so much the experience of management within the cooperative, but the stubborn struggle that its members have maintained right from the beginning against this immense power.

The story of the Bauen begins in the most tragic period in our recent history, the civilian-military dictatorship that was inflicted on our people between 1976 and 1983. A dark web of interests and maneuvers defined the profile of businesses in the contractor homeland and the economic groups that grew and profited from being cozy with the dictatorship. The Iurcovich group, which founded the Bauen SACIC, is one of them, a little cousin of larger ones like the group Macri. The Bauen was, until its closure in December of 2001, the hotel of power.

And now, since its recovery by the cooperative, it is the workers' hotel, the people's hotel. This is its story.

### About this book

This book is a collective creation. Its authors, those of us who drafted it, did interviews, and collected material, are members of the Open Faculty Program of the University of Buenos Aires, a university extension team that has studied businesses recovered by workers since 2002. Emiliano Balaguer and Desiderio Alfonso worked on the documentary part and on putting together the body of information that established the core of the text, but the rest of the team collaborated in different ways. The undersigned, Andrés Ruggeri, is the author of the final draft.

But it would be misleading to say that the three of us who sign are the sole authors. The BAUEN cooperative workers provided their experiences and an enormous amount of documentation that form the skeleton of data and information that give shape to the final product. Federico Tonarelli, especially, was the great organizer of information, of where to search, and who to ask. The testimony of María Eva Lossada, Marcelo Ruarte, Horacio Lalli, Arminda Palacios (who, unfortunately, passed away a few days before we finished the first draft), Gladys Alegre, and Federico himself, are the nerves and the muscles of this story. Fabián Pierucci, who recorded the whole history of the BAUEN from the beginning with his camera, and who made the great documentary BAUEN: Struggle, culture and work, provided the script of his movie, from which were extracted the remaining personal stories.

Diego Carbone, the cooperative's lawyer, contributed to a better comprehension of some of the intricate legal matters that surround this story. We are also beneficiaries of journalistic research, published by Santiago O’Donnell and Guillermo Berasategui, who have contributed greatly to the knowledge of the hidden web of asset-stripping and business fraud, together with judge Roberto Gallardo and their criminal complaint, whic added important data to be able reconstruct that framework.

Finally, this book is also part of a cooperative effort, edited, designed, and printed by worker cooperatives. It is also, in that sense, an integral part of the self-management movement.

Whatever happens after the arbitrary end of this book, which is required by circumstances and our time, which is limited by publishing and writing needs, we are convinced that the ending remains open, even if the correlation of forces seems indicate something else. It remains because of the workers' struggle and, since that struggle is going to continue, we know the next edition will have a happier and less uncertain ending.

## The Cinderella of expropriation

At the corner of the National Congress that leads to the Senate Chamber, at the intersection of Entre Ríos and Hipólito Yrigoyen, a group of around two hundred people blocked two lanes of traffic, holding a long sign.

Some of the protesters wore a black t-shirt with white lettering, the back of which read: “Put on the BAUEN t-shirt.” Off to the side, dangling from the bars that protected the Parliament from the crisis of 2001, a big flag with the Argentine colors called for the expropriation of the hotel BAUEN,[^1] one of the largest and best-known recovered businesses in the country.

The BAUEN is a twenty-story hotel with 220 rooms, located only four blocks from Congress, at the intersection of Callao and Corrientes. It has been occupied by its former workers since March 21, 2003, and put back in operation with enormous efforts by the cooperative they formed, but they never managed to normalize its legal situation, due to a complex web of interests and concealments built by the same business group that had constructed it with public money during the period of the civilian-military dictatorship.

[^1]: Note from the authors: Throughout the book, we're going to use the name of the hotel in two ways: Bauen to refer to the employer business that managed it until December 2001 and the residual company that continues to use the name; and BAUEN (with capital letters) for the worker cooperative that recovered it.

The BAUEN cooperative is an acronym for *Buenos Aires, Una Empresa Nacional* [Worker Cooperative Buenos Aires A National Business], which we use without periods for ease of reading.

It was close to 3:00 PM on November 30, 2016, and a blazing sun shone down on the group. They had gathered there because there was a serious possibility that the law expropriating the hotel in favor of the cooperative would be approved during that workday, the last of the ordinary annual sessions of Congress. It was that day or never, because if it was not voted on, the bill would lose parliamentary status, which is to say, it could not be brought up, but rather, would be dismissed. For the BAUEN workers, that possibility would be a political tragedy. It had taken a great deal of work, after thirteen years of self-management and resistance, to reach the approval of the expropriation law in the Chamber of Deputies almost a year before. [*Translator's note: the Argentine legislative system is very similar to the US legislative system: the upper house of Congress, the Senate, and lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, must pass identical versions of a bill, and then it can be signed or vetoed by the President.*] The legislators had voted on the bill as part of a package of 90 others, of widely varying kinds, at the last moment, on the last day possible before the change of government. Since had been presented, the bill had barely advanced at all, vegetating in the Senate, where it was sent December 1, 2015. Since that day, it had not been moved.

Protesters flowed in and out. Workers from the hotel or from other cooperatives and recovered businesses, members of the Argentine Federation of Self-Managed Worker Cooperatives (FACTA), supporters, and activists in solidarity with the BAUEN rotated to assure a permanent presence throughout the whole day, as news and rumors circulated among them. Police watched over the scene and rerouted traffic on Entre Ríos. Congress was blockaded, and there was little possibility of getting much closer to the place where part of the cooperative's fate was being decided. Expectation was growing, and there was no real news about what was happening inside, where no less than the national budget was being debated. Also, the Senate did not even allow observers, which is why no representative of the cooperative had had a chance to enter so far.

The bill had been presented that morning to the plenary of committees to be taken up, as required, but quorum had not been reached. It then had to be proposed on the floor, which meant it had to be voted on and passed in a sort of first round to reach the possibility of a definitive vote. It was an obstacle course that needed to be threaded before midnight, since the session expired then. A nervous joke started to circulate among the protesters, comparing it to Cinderella's carriage, which turned into a pumpkin at midnight. If the hour passed and it was not approved, the law would turn into pumpkin, too.

### A complicated year

The expropriation bill presented by Deputy Carlos Heller and merged with four more similar bills had recently been approved at a particularly delicate time for the country, when the Kirchner government was on the way out, and Mauricio Macri was about to win the day in the second round of Presidential elections.

From the point of view of a recovered business like the BAUEN, the ideal thing would have been to end up approving the law before December 10, 2015, to be signed by  still-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and thereby avoid the risk of a veto by the new president, who already had a history of doing exactly that as Chief of Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The bill had managed to pass the Chamber of Deputies, but the Senators had not yet addressed it.

The year that followed was marked by the advance of the neoliberal agenda and a style of government rarely seen in democratically elected authorities: trying avoid Parliament, abusing Decrees of Necessity and Urgency (even to modify or nullify laws, like the Law of Audiovisual Communication Services), pressuring legislators by manipulating provincial  budgets, etc.

A brutal rate hike on electricity, gas, and water services was imposed, which was soon seen to not only affect homes, but small and medium businesses, and we could go so far as to say industry in general. Popular resistance began to organize, and one of the main examples was the Multisectorial Against the Rate Hike, which began to meet, like so many other people's struggles, at the BAUEN. In spite of facing sometimes large social demonstrations, the government dug in and appeared extremely firm, with remarkable control of the situation during all of 2016.

The question for the cooperative was how to overcome this impasse, in which the law was half-approved (only by the Chamber of Deputies). It was mainly a matter of finding valid spokespeople in the Senate to talk with to move ahead on passing the bill. The person who provided the starting point was Deputy Omar Plaini, then the administrative secretary of the recently unified General Confederation of Labor and leader of the newspaper-sellers union. Through Marcelo Amodio, director of the Free Faculty of Recovered Factories of the National University of La Plata and consultant to Plaini, a series of meetings was organized betwen the directorate of the CGT and organizations of recovered businesses and cooperatives. One of them was FACTA. Federico Tonarelli, vice-president of the BAUEN cooperative and president of the federation, recounts that “the relationship between the BAUEN and Plaini is historical. He was one of the supporters of the bill in the committees of the Chamber of Deputies.” At the beginning of September 2016, the meeting was held between FACTA and Omar Plaini. Federico himself attended, as did Carlos Ortiz and Fabio Resino, treasurer and trustee, respectively, of the federation.

Omar tells us that he wants introduce topics of worker co-ops and recovered businesses to the CGT, so we set up a work schedule. One of the topics was the conflict at the Sadowa meat-packing plant, in Mar del Plata, and the other the BAUEN, so he would help us in the Senate. It's there he tells us “I'll take care of it, we'll talk in a few days.” And that's what happened, he calls me a few days later and puts me in contact with Senator Juan Manuel Irrazábal, a Senator from Misiones, in the Front for Victory Party.

That relationship with Irrazábal was strategic. The Senator directed his whole team, especially his niece, Silvina Irrazábal, to work with the BAUEN cooperative and its expropriation bill. “Since the day I met her and we had the first meeting, Silvina talked with me daily,” relates Tonarelli. This is how meetings were organized with Alfredo Martínez, a radical from Santa Cruz, and with Juan Manuel Abal Medina, Senator from the Front for Victory for the province of Buenos Aires. Martínez was president of the Committee of Administrative and Municipal Affairs, and Abal Medina, president of the Senate Budget Committee. “Analysis of the BAUEN bill had begun in these two committees, and the year was winding down, we were already practically at the end of 2016,” continues the President of FACTA, who also recalls that:

Finally, seeing that there was no agreement in their committees to advance, they called a plenary meeting of the two committees, but only on the last day of sessions. The last day, in the last session, they call a plenary of committees in the morning, practically at the same time the session began.

They did not have quorum, and the meeting did not happen. The opportunity to pass the bill through the committees was lost. Almost at the same time, the chamber session was beginning. When it looked like everything was going to fail, Irrazábal announced to the workers that he was going to ask for the bill to be introduced from the floor, and for Miguel Ángel Pichetto, the party leader, to accept it. Time was ticking away, independent of the number of bills that had to be dealt with. The closure of the session at midnight was inescapable, and the time the bill would expire was approaching. If it passed, the bill with half-approval of the Deputies would die, and could not be raised again. As of noon, the bill had not even been listed among those to be addressed.

### Legislative dueling

Outside Congress, people were gathering to support the workers. The sun blazed down, adding one more difficulty. The tension in the air was palpable, and as more news arrived, addressing and approving expropriation seemed further away. At one point, those present were surprised to see a sky-blue and white flag rise slowly up the flagpole of the legislative palace, because instead of the warrior sun of the official flag, it had the word BAUEN painted on it. As protesters arrived, the police put up barriers, cutting off Hipólito Yrigoyen Street almost completely.

Irrazábal told Tonarelli to stay calm, that he had the votes. His affirmations were not enough to calm the anxiety of workers who had watched for years as all the bills they took to Congress failed.  To top it off, the last session of the 2016 was not just long, but the national budget was scheduled to be dealt with. The body met and prepared itself for a session that would have to finish at the toll of midnight. A rumor circulated, rife with fear, that the bill was not even going to be able to be put on the day's agenda. Because the bill was being introduced by Deputies without committee endorsement, there had to be an initial vote.

News reached the street that its inclusion had been approved. Hope grew. In contrast to what had happened in the lower house, where workers had followed the session from the balconies, in the Senate, they had no access to the chamber. What was happening inside was communicated via WhatsApp or telephone by legislative aides and Congressional workers, collaborating with the workers. Irrazábal already had the agreement of his whole bloc, which was the majority, to rush the approval. But they had to avoid the predictable stalling tactics of the opposition.

Irrazábal asked the provisional President of the Senate, Federico Pinedo, who had already expressed his extreme opposition to the expropriation of the BAUEN, for the floor, and asked for the bill to be introduced. “It comes without opinion of committee,” he clarified. That first round showed that the correlation of forces was favorable to expropriation: the motoin to take up the bill was approved with 43 votes in favor and 16 against. The problem was not going to be the number of votes, but time.

The session went on as the budget was debated. Outside, the protesters held on stoically. They were the longstanding members of the BAUEN, those who had occupied and resisted for years, together with other newer but equally committed *compañeros*, but the hotel stayed open, and the rest of the workers had to go on working to keep it operating. They were even more nervous than the ones outside Congress.

The budget was voted on after 9 PM, with less than three hours remaining for the expropriation to be approved. Meanwhile, night had fallen, and people were waiting and worrying outside. Inside, they moved on to deal with the proposals from the floor, and the first was a bill about wetlands. The debate on this bill took time. The nervousness grew. There were several bills from the floor to be dealt with, and it was already obvious that there was not enough time for all of them. The Senators from the opposition were using a “Bilardo strategy” of running out the clock, so the session would end and the expropriation would not happen. [*Translator's note: Carlos Bilardo is a soccer coach with an aggressive and unscrupulous style.*]

Federico Tonarelli contacted Silvina Irrazabal and Abal Medina's staff to let them enter the session.

I made a bit of a “scene” outside and, finally, at about 10:00 at night, they let me in. I go into the hall, they come down from the office of Abal Medina and Silvina Irrazábal, and there I make another “scene,” saying that I wasn't going alone, that had to let my *compañeros* in. There, Senate security agreed to let one more person in. That's where they open the door for me and I call Eva (María Eva Lossada, chairwoman of the cooperative), who was on the street, and the let the two of us go in.

That did not mean that they entered the chamber, but the Arturo Illia Room, where all the staff were, with an enormous television on which they were watching the session live.

There, we started to communicate via WhatsApp with Juan Manuel Irrazábal, who was on the other side of the wall, in the chamber, and he reiterated to us that he has an agreement with the leader of the bloc, Miguel Pichetto, to vote for the bill. Then I tell him, “Juanchi, things aren't looking good with the schedule...,” and he answers me that all that was left was to ask for the alteration of the order so that the topic of the BAUEN would be the next to be dealt with, because there were still twenty-some bills left. Pichetto gives it the OK, us too, and we get in touch with the ones outside so they'd know what was happening. This happened around 11, with practically no time for anything else.

Sure enough, the moment the previous topic was settled, Irrazábal asks for the floor and engages in a tense dialogue with the Vice-President Gabriela Michetti, who was now in charge of the session. It was the second round, and to be able to alter the order, two thirds of the Senators were needed. Outside, some were taking account, trying to imagine whether they would make it or not.

### Prayers and WhatsApp messages

Irrazábal asks for the floor: “Aware of how late it is, and of the imminent possibility of the loss of parliamentary status of a half-sanctioned bill that comes unanimously approved by the Chamber of Deputies, I am going to request that the work plan be modified.” The proposal is received with murmurs and agitation by the opposition Senators, but the vote takes place, after a certain stalling by Michetti. The result is favorable: 42 to 17.

Outside, there is a happy commotion, but also nervousness, because there was very little time left for voting.

At that moment, Federico recalls:

>  Silvina Irrazábal and I were exchanging messages by WhatsApp with Juanchi Irrazábal on the other side of the wall, from within the chamber, and also out with Fabio (Resino, leader of FACTA) to keep the *compañeros* informed. And Eva, I remember perfectly, was praying, between sobs, with her hands clasped, sitting in her chair while we were exchanging messages. And there too, a fellow that works in the Senate joined us, Oscar Leguizamón, who stayed with us, watching the last moves live. This was all half an hour before the bell rang.

Eva's prayers, Federico's messages, Senator Irrazábal's skill in managing the situation and, above all that, the justice of the BAUEN workers' cause, all converged in what came next. Gabriela Michetti, presiding over the session as Vice-President, showed her usual incompetence and tried to delay the debate. Some Senators intervened and tried to vote individually to use up time, as Irrazábal was saying that they should vote on the whole package for the obvious reason of the time limit.

Outside, the crowd had moved from the corner to the door of the Senate, on Hipólito Yrigoyen Street, where traffic had been flowing until it was blocked by the number of people gathered. There was a line of cops blocking the door. Little groups had formed around a few people who had managed to pull in the Senate TV channel that was transmitting the session live on their cellphones. Silence fell all around as the debate went on. Everyone kept an eye on their watches.

Irrazábal made a brief argument for the bill:

> This is a half-sanctioned bill that tries to give a definitive solution to a situation that is taking place in the BAUEN hotel. There, a worker cooperative has been managing the hotel for almost fourteen years. It's a very long story, and I won't tell it now.

Faced with muttering and questions from some Senators, Irrazábal cut them off. “You want me to make it short? All right, I'll make it very short,” and he explained the three main points of the law: the political solution to the long legal conflict, the interest of the workers and the State, and the social function the hotel was meant to serve. The Senator argued but also was watching the clock out of the corner of his eye. He also proposed a final vote on all bills at eleven. Petcoff Naidenoff asked for the floor to repeat the arguments of the bosses who complained about the hotel, saying that there was a legal solution and that he wanted time to study the case. Of course, time to study the case would mean the demise of the bill. Several Senators asked for the floor, which is why another Senator from the Front for Victory, Anabel Fernández Sagasti, made a point of order to force voting. There was then a brief debate, almost a skirmish, between those who did and did not want to allow the point of order to put the vote on the schedule. Senator Pinedo did not deny himself a brief intervention that paints a clear picture of the posture of Macri's supporters towards the BAUEN and the recovered businesses in general:

> Madame President, this is a peculiar case that has already been rejected in other jurisdictions, for example in the City of Buenos Aires. It is a case in which the value of good is enormous–it is a building at Callao and Corrientes– and the beneficiaries are very few. So, to put up money of all Argentines, people with extreme need, to give away a fortune to a very few people, is something that we we cannot vote for.

Two of the “very few people” followed the scene very nervously from the room where they were. Eva, Federico recalls, “was in anguish, she prayed until she cried, and I was sitting next to her, constantly on WhatsApp.”

Outside, the session was struggling to keep up through cell phones, through messages from Federico that were reaching Fabio, and through others who were communicating with other people within the Senate, who spread the word to others.

Finally, another Senator, Eduardo Aguilar, was able to call the question. It was the third round the BAUEN had been through. The voting again ended up 41 to 17, and only one step was left, the last obstacle in that session of anguish. As votes were counted in the system and final voting was opened, several Senators and the Vice-President tried confuse and delay voting. Eva kept praying. Some Senators had left, which is what those outside were afraid of, and why some people who were leaving the Senate were not well received as they passed the protesters, who did not know for certain whether they were legislators or not. There was even debate about what was being voted on, which was very confusing, until Michetti was forced to put the expropriation to a vote. Again, it won, 39 to 17.

This time, the BAUEN really had been expropriated.

### The story does not end there

Endless hugs, shouts of jubilation, tears, and a tumult of joy met Federico and María Eva when they left the chamber. Everyone burst into song, and started to march to their building at Callao 360, with the flag of the cooperative at the front, to celebrate with their *compañeros*, the workers who had remained in the hotel. There, an improvised party was put together in the rooms, which soon included more and more people, as they found out about the law passing. Senators Irrazábal and Abal Medina also arrived. No one could contain their joy.

But there was a danger, which was predictable enough: a Presidential veto. Given Mauricio Macri's background and the nature of his government, it was highly probable that this would happen. The president had a period of ten days, usually interpreted as business days, to sign or veto a law from Congress. The 26th of December, on vacation in Villa La Angostura, Macri, barely expanding on Pinedo's arguments, signed Decree 1302/16, which vetoes the expropriation of the BAUEN hotel, numbered as 27344, completely.[^2] A simple signature, a stroke of the pen, to undo years of effort by the workers and underwrite a scam on the people, on the workers, and on the State.

## The dark web of Bauen SACIC

“Too much money for a few people,” said Senator Federico Pinedo in opposition to the expropriation of the hotel Bauen for the cooperative, when it was being discussed in the National Senate. This a common ideological stance, which is also held by some judges who objected to the Constitutionality of expropriation laws for businesses recovered by their workers, which says that the “public utility” on which these laws are based would not make sense, because they concern “a private group” or “a small number of people.” One can argue with many examples and reasons why a business recovered by its workers is not “a private group” (while cooperatives are private entities according to Argentine legislation, it is clear that they are not companies that belong to one person or for-profit corporate group, and in many countries of the world, they are recognized as social property) and even less “a small number of people,” because they carry out social, cultural, and economic activities for the common good, and are basically collectives that restart a productive organization that strengthens the economic fabric of the country and especially of the communities they work in.

In the case of the Bauen, however, this stance shows absolute ignorance or the greatest hypocrisy, because if ever there was a situation in which a “private group” received a fortune for enjoyment of a “small number” of people (in this case, Marcelo Iurcovich and family) it was precisely the Bauen SACIC business. And this situation happened in times that were not the least bit democratic: the civilian-military dictatorship of 1976-1983.

### The Bauen and the dictatorship

When there is talk of business complicity with the dictatorship, it is well worth taking the Bauen hotel as an example, as one of many negotiated in the complicity that showed so crudely in those years. This relationship meant not only the support of the business community for those who committed genocide, but the repayment of that connivance with businesses and specific benefits. Marcelo Iurcovich was one of these beneficiaries. The building was constructed in record time with public money, provided by the former National Bank of Development (BANADE), to be able to meet hospitality demand during the 1978 World Cup. Although the publicists for the business that alleges to own the building (Mercoteles, S.A., chaired by the junior Iurcovich) asserts that this loan was paid off and that this was legally recognized, because Bauen SACIC even filed a lawsuit against the nation-State for non-payment, no legal files or files at the Ministry of Economy establish any evidence of such payments. Quite the opposite: in the file of residual debts left after the liquidation of BANADE, under Menem, the Bauen debt appears together with dozens of other businesses in the same situation, showing this to be a normal practice in corporate business deals with the State, which only increased when their friends in the dictatorship governed the country.

This data was investigated by the workers themselves. In 2012, a criminal complaint was even filed against the Iurcoviches for this scam and their complicity with the dictatorship. After a year and a half of resting in a judicial box somewhere, the report was permanently archived by Judge Casanello without any sort of investigation. The long arm of economic power meets little resistance in the courts, which is a constant theme in the Bauen cause. That long arm tries to block recognition that the Hotel Bauen deserves to be managed by the workers who rebuilt it from the disastrous condition it was left in after the fraudulent bankruptcy of the business in the late '90s and early '00s. What is referred to as “a lot of money” is really what the Argentine State needs to recover from the old debt that was never “honored” (as governments like to say to justify the payment of predatory and parasitical external debt). It could not be otherwise, after all, in the context of a government whose almost sole purpose is to put public funds in the pockets of far fewer people than work at the Bauen hotel.

### The origins of the Bauen: the 1978 World Cup

“Even though it cost 700 million dollars, for the first time, we Argentines know what things cost, and we will pay that debt, even if it does not turn out to be easy.” This was the opening of an editorial in the magazine *Gente* from June first, 1978, one of the many media outlets committed to propaganda service to the military dictatorship. In those days, they devoted their full efforts to whitewashing the image of the country, due to that old concern for “how they see us abroad.” That image was stained by the crimes of the military junta, or, from its perspective, what it had come to call the “anti-Argentina campaign,” which is to say, the accusations of disappearances, torture, and murders perpetrated by the State. Overseas, especially in European countries, these accusations were made by political exiles and human-rights organizations, and only foreign media published them. The amount referred to the cost of the 1978 World Cup, the massive sporting event organized by the Independent World Cup Body '78 (EAM 78), which the military junta used to try to sell the world on the idea that “we Argentines are upstanding and humane.” Four years later, Spain would organize their own World Cup for a quarter the cost. Vice-Admiral Carlos Alberto Lacoste, who was in charge of the EAM 78, bragged about not keeping track of the accounting of the organization he administrated.[^3] “In spite of our scant hotel infrastructure, in less than two years, we raised model hotels and defeated a disease that seemed chronic,” *Gente* went on in another paragraph of the editorial. It was alluding primarily to the Bauen.

This context—dictatorship, unclear accounting, debts that would not be easy to pay, and five-star hotels built at top speed[^4] to house the teams and tourists that the World Cup would bring—is where the Bauen had its origins. The building is a 60-meter-tall tower with 220 rooms on twenty floors, plus meeting rooms and an auditorium, built in the downtown of the capital of the Argentine Republic, and it came to be the undisputed emblem of the movement of businesses recovered by their workers that was born 25 years later. This was surely something never imagined by Marcelo Iurcovich, the businessman who pulled off the miracle of building an enormous hotel without investing a single peso.

[^4]: May 19, 1978, at the time of its construction, the Architecture Engineering, Planning, and Design supplement to the newspaper *Clarín* was titled: “A slab every six days,” highlighting the speed and the method used. That same day, on pages 2 and 3 of that supplement, there was also a note on “The use of prefabrication to shorten work time.”

### The Iurcoviches

Marcelo Iurcovich was born in 1923 and died April 3, 2003. He was married to Raquel Kaliman, daughter of Moisés Israel Kaliman. Their son, Hugo Iurcovich, succeeded him at the head of his businesses, and he continues there today. The civilian-military dictatorship that came to power with the coup d'etat on March 24, 1976, inherited an excellent opportunity from the government of María Estela Martínez de Perón to try to bleach its image and take advantage of the Argentine people's soccer fever by leveraging the organization of the 1978 soccer World Cup for favorable political and propaganda purposes. The event was the target of boycott campaigns, especially at the international level, which was denounced by the dictatorship as part of an “anti-Argentina campaign,” which was then echoed by the domestic print and broadcast media. The dictatorship set up a clandestine press office in the loft of the ESMA for this purpose—in which detainees archived the information about Argentina published by foreign media—and from there, information favorable to the regime was spread.

To successfully host the world championship, the organizers considered it necessary to build numerous infrastructure works, like highways, communication networks, sports stadiums, and, crucially for our story, five-star hotels to house the numerous delegations that would visit the country. In his *History of Argentine Tourism*, Wallingre makes it clear that the dictatorship disbursed a series of soft loans for the hotel infrastructure necessary for the '78 World Cup, with which “hotels were built in Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Mendoza. Among others in the four and five-star category are The Americas, the Bauen, the Conqueror, and the Elevage hotels in Buenos Aires.”[^5]

Here is where Marcelo Iurcovich appears: according to an article published by journalist Santiago O'Donnell in the newspaper *Página/12*,[^6] his excellent relationships with the military government, especially with Brigadier General Osvaldo Cacciattore, by then the de facto mayor of the City of Buenos Aires, and with ship captain (later rear admiral) Carlos Alberto Lacoste, who was the head of the EAM 78,[^7] allowed Iurcovich get a very favorable loan from BANADE for the construction of a five-star hotel in the very center of the capital.

[^6]: Santiago O’Donnell, “The father, the son and a spirit non sancto,” in Página/12, 21 August of 2007.

Research by O'Donnell points out that, after the death of Marcelo Iurcovich, his son Hugo became the visible face of the group.

> Those who know him say he maintains certain a rebellion in his manner and something of a hippie vibe, which was perhaps a product of the time he spent in Buzios setting up a megaresort. His friends say that Hugo felt at ease with celebrities, without abandoning the low profile that characterizes the family, which is perhaps why he turned his artistic vocation into business related to entertainment, as suggested by his participation in the boards of compnies like Deporcor and Event Organizing, in addition to real-estate dealings through of the boards of Sedaguma and Suma.[^8]

O'Donnell continues his precise description of the family Iurcovich businesses:

> Raquel Kaliman, the wife of Marcelo and mother of Hugo, also dabbled in real-estate business, through the Consultex firm, registered at the group's offices at Corrientes 1500. She shared the directorate of Consultex with the counter Sterin and with Alejandro Granillo Ocampo, family of the former functionary polyfunctional from the government of Carlos Menem, Raúl Granillo Ocampo. It seems that, Kaliman did not chose the most solvent member, since Alejandro presides over (and Raúl was in the directorate of) the a construction company based in La Rioja, Construnoa, which lists unrecoverable credits of more than 2 million pesos.

It also links the Iurcoviches, more recently, with a real-estate businesses in Puerto Madero through the Sycic company, “a detachment stockholder of the family business Polytechnics” and shareholder of the constructive JM Aragon, Dique 1 and Puerto Santo. As for Polytechnics, it is a company dedicated to the maintenance of clinics and hospitals that became infamous on June 30th of 2005, during a episode in which two patients at the Santojanni Hospital died as a result of a mistake made during these maintenance tasks, as the newspaper *Clarín* put it.[^9]

## How to scam the State

The complex business framework we have described provides the starting point for the asset-stripping and bankruptcy of the Bauen hotel, which was a scam on the treasury right from the beginning. The plot of this operation is widely detailed in a work by Federico Tonarelli (former president of the cooperative, current vice-president, and president of the Argentine Federation of Self-Managed Worker Cooperatives, FACTA) and Fabián Pierucci (economist and filmmaker, director of the documentary *BAUEN, struggle, work, culture*[^10]), which was included in the book *Crisis and Self-management in the 21st Century*.[^11] In that text, the authors give an exhaustively detailed explanation of the large-scale financial plot to scam the State (and, therefore, the Argentine people) by means of the construction of the Bauen and its later appropriation by the Iurcoviches' business. In his words:

>  At the beginning of the '80s, Bauen, SA, sued BANADE for noncompliance in granting the above-mentioned credit, as a strategy of repudiating the original debt, of extending time periods, and of liquidating the amount originally owed in a context of high inflation. After having made only a few payments consisting of amortization of interests, until the whole amount agreed with the BANADE was disbursed, plus the expansions to the original credit for changes in the building project, no more payments were ever made on the amount due to the bank. In March of 2007, there was a ruling by the Court of Appeals, which is in the Supreme Court of the Nation today, in the case of *Bauen SACIC vs BANADE* where the liquidation indicates that the debt to BANADE, updated to April 1, 1991, is AR$4,670,262.84. Applying a 5% annual interest rate between January first, 1983, and March 31, 2007, gives on amount of $11,118,718, minus a penalty of $2,502,193 imposed on BANADE for noncompliance with timely disbursing of the installments, gives a final balance of $8.616.524 in favor of BANADE. **
>
> In the liquidation we can notice that the period of 1991 to 2007 was not updated, which meant a considerable liquifiction of the debt. Now, if we go through the exercise of applying the fee for noncompliance of the sentence of 5% monthly on capital of origin over the 62 months from the sentence to the present, the amount of AR$4,670,262.84 becomes AR$14,477,814.80, which, updated by IPIM 2012/2007 [*the Index of Wholesale Prices*], brings us close to a debt of $25,000,000 today.[^12] This judgment largely achieves the objective of the economic group led by Iurcovich: to hold on to the building he profited from since it was constructed practically for free. This strategy of a chain of successive scams allowed the economic group which, today demands ownership of the building, to use the flow of revenue created by the hotel to become rich and invest in other ventures, which are public knowledge (Bauen Suite in Buenos Aires, Bauen Buzios in Brazil, etc.) without any kind of State control.”[^13] 

[^12]: N. of the To.: the date of publication of the book of which is taken the quote is 2014.
[^13]: Fabián Pierucci and Federico Tonarelli, ob. cit., pp. 153-154.

The maneuvers of chaining between firms that are bought and sold as a way to hide the true owners and the origin of capital, the loans from public banks and never paid, debt waivers or transfers to the State, and lawsuits against the State to obstruct investigations (something like a thief shouting “stop, thief”), are typical maneuvers by which business groups of the so-called “contractor homeland” grow at the expense of the public treasury, and get rich without risking more than a minimal portion of their capital (if any). The Iurcoviches are no exception, but almost an minor player compared with the Macri group, which made constant use of this modus operandi[^14] and kept Marcelo Iurcovich almost at the level of an apprentice.

These kinds of maneuvers, not coincidentally, are at the origin of several businesses later recovered by the workers, with the BANADE (and the workers who were cheated and left unemployed) playing the role of the figurehead on the prow of the State's ship of fools. The stories of the recovered businesses usually run together through bonds of solidarity established by workers at the various businesses during recovery. But long before this happens, when they worked under orders from their bosses, many of the preexisting businesses, without their employees knowing, were already beginning to share certain elements that shaped the economic and financial flows of a stage in the recent economic history of the country.  Bauen workers recovered the hotel after hearing the story of Chilavert, a recovered print shop, in a meeting convened by the printers and held in their shop, but the names of both businesses were already in the files of the National Bank of Development, where the loans granted to the businesspeople that exploited them were held.

A document from 2001 updated the amounts owed in pesos (peso-dollars of convertibility) to the year 2000. The 1,325 debtor companies—quite a crowd—include the following data among the businesses that workers occupied and recovered, or at least tried:

- Bauen SACIC (Legajo 46,414), with a total debt of $85,476,895 and in situation 5[^15]
- Viniplast SAIC (Legajo 49,170), with a total debt of $4,383,493 and in situation 5
- Hilanderías M.G. SA (Legajo 49,365), with a total debt of $2,818,226 and in situation 5
- Cerámica Zanon SACIM (Legajo 45,959), with a total debt of $125,739 and in situation 5
- Cerámica Stefani Cutral-có SACIFA (Legajo 46,555), with a total debt of $924,690 and in situation 5
- Gaglianone Est. Printing SACI (Legajo 42,082), with a total debt of $13,669
- Sasetru SACIFIAE (Legajo 28.128), with a total debt of $26.144.239 and situation 6
- Elecrodomésticos Aurora SA (Legajo 33,210), with a total debt of $3,819,984 and in situation 6
- Frigorífico Minguillón SA (Legajo 37,879), with a total debt of $59,733,947 and in situation 6
- Frigorífico Yaguané SACIFA (Legajo 43,104), with a total debt of $42,246,746 and in situation 6.

[^14]: As demonstrated, for example, by the case of debt forgiveness by the Argentine Mail carried out by Mauricio Macri towards his own family as soon as he reached power, and which exploded in February of 2017.

[^15]: Situation 5 corresponds to adjudicated debts, and 6 to those still in dispute in bankruptcy proceedings.

These are the social reasons of the businesses that asked BANADE for loans they never finished paying, if they even started, or ever intended to. The liquidation of the National Bank of Development during the government of Carlos Menem facilitated things things for them. Gaglianone Establecimiento Gráfico SACI is currently the recovered business Chilavert Graphic Arts Worker Cooperative, Ltd., while Electrodomésticos Aurora SA was rebaptized by the workers as Renacer [*Rebirth*] Worker Cooperative, Ltd.  With the exception of Sasetru, all the others are also worker cooperatives today, but their names retain some reference to the fantasy name used by the bosses, and are found scattered around the country, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Neuquén, and Tierra del Fuego.

Apart from the amounts involved in the case of Sasetru (a gigantic enterprise in the food industry, which was able to become one of the main exporters in the country), the Iurcovich family is the biggest debtor to BANADE, as a result of the loan it managed through EAM 78 to finance 79% of the construction of the hotel. The origin of that debt was a loan of eight million pesos. The workers calculated that, by 2012, with the interest updated, it represented some 170 million pesos.[^16]

The operation, initiated by the contract signed November 30, 1976, was carried out under Circular VI.2.158, a set of ad hoc rules designed by the BANADE. The judge, in the sentence that ruled in favor of the former owners, summarized it as follows:

[^16]: Manuel Alfieri, “Those who ask for to evict al Bauen owe to the State $170 million” in daily *Tiempo Argentina*, 21 October of 2012, pp. 24-25.

Loans were designed with exceptionally benign conditions, which is to say, structured with the specific and declared end of serving the promotion of the construction of hotels in the Federal Capital, Mendoza, and Rosario for the XI World Championship of Soccer. That's why these promotional loans were subject to special regulations (Circular VI.2.158), which adopted as a base of adjustment of capital the variation of the stock quote of the Adjustable National Values; a variation that, as was pointed out, in the considering X of this vote, was far lower than the evolution of wholesale prices.[^17]

That is, the project under which the loan was conceived of anticipated a scene of decreasing inflation, which was very different from what really took place.

Indeed, was the growing inflation of early of the '80s that led BANADE to enforce indexing regimes that would favor it, to try preserve its assets.

The contract signed with Bauen SACIC stipulated a series of disbursements that the BANADE would make to the extent that the firm presented the certificates that gave an account of the progress of the work. Shortly after beginning, Iurcovich's business introduced a series of modifications to the original plans approved by the bank, consisting of an increased parking, an expansion of the conference hall, and the construction of a pool. The BANADE approved these modifications, but stated that the loan should be understood in two parts. Part A would correspond to the original project, which is to say, the terms of the soft loan offered on a privileged basis to those who who were constructing hotel infrastructure for the '78 World Cup. Part B, provided for the improvements and expansions presented later by Bauen SACIC (and which would elevate the hotel to a category of five stars), the loan would have an ordinary character, with the same rights and responsibilities that any natural or legal person commits to upon accessing a facility of this kind (same interest rates, same indexing regime, etc.). The owners of the Bauen did not agree with this distinction, and alleged, on the contrary, that the bank was at fault in a period of assignment of the disbursements (although it should be clarified that, sooner or later, they recieved them all, first to last). Following this (they argued in the case they filed against the bank in October of 1981), they had been forced to go out to ask for other loan to comply with the terms of construction of the hotel.

[^17]: CNCyCom, Room II, “Bauen SACIC c/ National Bank of Development s/ fulfillment of credit obligation,” cause 8641/IV, fs. 2997, April of 1997, judgment of the judge Eduardo Vocos Conesa to which too adheres the judge Marina Mariani of Vidal.

In parallel, the BANADE filed suit against the Bauen for noncompliance in payment. There was also a whole constellation of secondary cases (among them, criminal cases for falsification of seals) that complicate the panorama even more.

What is clear in all this judicial imbroglio, even in this case that the Bauen filed against the BANADE, is not only a problem in the administration of the State bank (which had, in fact, made its disbursements an average of 52 days late), but also the modus operandi of the then-owners of the hotel: fake balance sheets,[^18] falsification of seals (which would permit it to ask for a new loan, this time from the Rio Bank, using as collateral the same property already mortgaged by the loan provided to it by the BANADE) and a disastrous financial situation resulting from bad administration.

The attempts to collect the remainder through the Banco Nación, the entity that managed the residual portfolio of the BANADE, included an agreement in 1994 with Bauen SACIC for six million dollars. At that time, parity of 1 peso = 1 dollar (Convertibility Law of 1991) was in effect, which established a more than favorable agreement for the Iurcoviches, since it notably reduced the original amount. Even so, the Iurcoviches would again fail to fulfill their agreements.[^19]

According to calculations done by Bauen workers in 2012, if the amount provided to the Iurcoviches was updated with the IPMNG,[^20] the 4,433,500,000 Pesos Ley (the currency in effect in 1978) would convert at that date to AR$86,805,736.77. If a preferential interest rate of 5% is applied to these (as stipulated in Circular VI.2.1958), the debt drops AR$147,569,752.50. Finally, if we discount from this calculation the penalty of $2,502,193 leveled on the BANADE in the sentence of 2007 (for noncompliance with the terms in the provision of the amounts) according to their updated value, in 2012, Bauen SACIC still owed the Nation-state approximately AR$122,569,752.[^21]

[^18]: “And while this does not have any legal standing, given the conclusions that have been drawn, he pointed out that the accountant of Bauen SA was sanctioned for reporting a false balance, but this sanction was left without effect by the justice system (fs. 105/107 of the file N° 6955 of the Professional Council of Economic Sciences – Court of Discipline, that runs for rope)” (“Bauen SACIC c/ National Bank of Development s/ fulfillment operation credit,” case N° 8641, fs. 1076 turn). The false balance consisted of the application of Circular 1050 of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic for the indexing of the debt, when “according to what was agreed upon, the correct action was to follow the variations of the IPMNG.” A major issue in this dispute between the BAUEN and the BANADE is what regime would be applied for the indexing of the debt in an inflationary context.

So, it is more and more clear that the construction of the Bauen through this unpaid debt to the BANADE can be understood as another chapter in the history of looting done by the “homeland contractor,” an expression usually used to designate friends of the powerful, who run businesses that make millions at the expense of the State. The Macri family, whose members were able to break into politics, coming to power in the government of Buenos Aires, and later, the presidency of the Nation undoubtedly belongs to this group. It should not surprise us that the Macris and the Iurcoviches were able to establish bonds two decades later (with Mauricio Macri already in charge of the executive branch of Buenos Aires) concerning the BAUEN hotel, which we will talk more about later.

### The debts to the Government of the City of Buenos Aires

Between 1991 and 1993, when its registered name was still Bauen SACIC, the business fell into debt to the City of Buenos Aires for non-payment of taxes on gross income (II.BB.) and for streetlights, street sweeping, and maintenance (ABL) for the sum of AR$794,640.54.

To deal with this debt, the business accepted a payment plan, as recorded in the General Directorate of Rents of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires (GCBA).[^22] However, it never completed it.

Because of this, the GCBA filed suit on December 4, 1994, through its lawyer, Ricardo Damonte, who, as a first step, requested that the limitation of the debt be suspended, as the law allows. Damonte stated in the suit:

> The omission of the payment of taxes is worse than noncompliance with a private debt, in that in the latter, the interest of an individual is affected, and, in the former, the good of the community.

On the basis of this, he asked the court to issue a guilty sentence and order the payment of the amount owed plus compensatory interest, punative fees, and costs.

After several legal manuevers, in December 1998, the business asked for a change of jurisdiction. This again delayed the whole 22 Decree 91/93, Application N° 77134, until March 14, 2001, when Damonte requested the decree be executed[^23] and Bauen SACIC be ordered to pay. On March 16, the Judicial Power of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ordered payment of the debt in five days, plus an additional 30% for interests and costs.

The attorneys of the Iurcoviches again appealed to judicial trickery, ignoring the debt and claiming that there was insufficient proof to prove the case, making an Olympic effort to ignore a prior report from the Directorate of Rents issued November 10, 1997, in which it was clear that the business accepted a payment plan. On April 4, 2001, they tried an even more unusual manuever: the legal representative of the Iurcoviches, Santiago Giordano, alleged that the debt had been regularized in a later payment plan, and requested that the costs of the trial be paid by the plaintiff, which is to say, the GCBA.[^24] In reality, and as Damonte would demonstrate, the lawyer of the business had not presented any documentation of the supposed arrangement.

What really had happened was very different: Bauen SACIC had accepted a plan in fifteen payments, of which it only made the first. That is, Giordano was making his demand on the basis of an arrangement that had expired for lack of pay, and on top of then, tried to make the State pay the costs of the trial. As we see, it is a constant in the conduct of the Iurcoviches to finance themselves one way or another with public funds (taking out loans that are not repaid, suing the State in shameless trials, not paying their tax obligations). In short, taking a page from the textbook on how to scam the public treasury used by most of the national business class (and the international business class operating in this country). As Damonte noted in hit written statement, “the disorder that the the defendant provokes is created with the sole objective of avoiding its fiscal obligations.”

On September 20, 2001, the court decreed the restraint of the goods of Bauen SACIC, and in April of 2002, Damonte, as legal representative of the GCBA, requested their auction. But the expertise of the firm's lawyers in drawing things out was, undoubtedly, great, and they were able to go on without paying absolutely anything until October 12, 2011, when the business' goods were embargoed, this time at the BAUEN Suite (the hotel constructed on Corrientes avenue, around the corner from the first), for a total, with interests and punative costs, of AR$4,736,057.62 (the original amount was of $794,640.54 as of 31/12/1998).

[^23]: Exp. N°63343/98.

EJF 63343 that processes the Fuero Contencioso Administrative and tributario, Court 2 Secretariat 3.” Fojas 19 and 20 of the acting judicial on charging ABL owed to the GCBA by Bauen SACIC.

But, once more, they were able to wriggle out of it. On January 6, 2012, the National Institute of Industrial Property made known to the court that the Bauen Suite brand was in the name of Hugo Eduardo Iurcovich, after a transfer made September 10, 2009, which was why it could not be seized for the debts of the old enterprise, Bauen SACIC. By all appearances, the son inherited the slimy ability of the father to never pay his debts.

The final curtain was pulled by the GCBA itself, which finally, and generously, wrote off the debts (which were, after all, extremely difficult to collect), and freed the Iurcoviches of this heavy burden. It is not strange, then, that eyewitnesses cited by Santiago O'Donnell in his article have said they heard Marcelo Iurcovich boast of having constructed a five-star hotel without disbursing a single peso.[^25] As a consequence of everything we have described, it is clear that from beginning to end, the Iurcovich group is less an investor group, and more a scavenger of capital at the expense of the State, and taking advantage of the considerable earnings from the hotel, Bauen SACIC diverted those funds towards the construction of the Bauen Suite on Corrientes avenue, and set up two phantom off-shore businesses in Uruguay and hotel ventures in Brazil and Puerto Iguazú, among other businesses. And, with the patience that comes from knowing that the system and time are on their side, it hopes that things will go back to how they always were, and the Bauen hotel, where everything started, will come back into their hands.

## The closure

“We were very happy about the World Cup, without knowing what was happening around us. We only saw the personalities who paraded by the hotel, while outside, people were being killed,” remembers Arminda Palacios, one of the members of the cooperative who worked at the hotel since its founding, or more precisely, a month prior to its opening.

Arminda's memory and that of other hotel workers takes on another dimension in the present. Currently, the BAUEN hotel (the name of the cooperative means *Buenos Aires, A National Business*[^26]) is a symbol of social struggles, the place where organizations in conflict meet, where mobilizations are proposed and discussed, congresses and union meetings are held, and political parties and academic groups get together. The recovered hotel is the place where the representatives of recovered businesses from different parts of the country converge when they come to Buenos Aires. The BAUEN is the place to stay for workers from the former Zanon (current FASINPAT), from Textiles Pigüé, from recovered businesses in Rosario, Cordoba, or Mendoza. It is were the Metrodelegados of the Buenos Aires Subway organized when they confronted the UTA union bureaucracy, and where so many political debates have been held that it would be difficult to list them.

[^26]: To distinguish the cooperative of private business of the Iurcoviches, we use "Bauen" for the company and "BAUEN" for the cooperative.

But in those years, the BAUEN was something very different, a symbol of the policy of the dominant classes, a hotel where the powerful, rich, and famous met. Being close to the theaters and entertainment venues on Corrientes avenue made it an optimum site for them to frequent the farándula, as well as characters from the Buenos Aires elite, businesspeople, functionaries of the governments of Videla a Menem, mixed with tourism with greater buying power that reached the Argentine capital. Olmedo and Porcel would film several of their movies there, and it would also be the headquarters of the official launch of different candidacies, especially during Menem's early years, when the hotel was in its splendor.

At the beginning of the '90s, the hotel starts to see other changes: the business “outfitted the fourth floor of the hotel with offices for rent, to attract Chilean executives coming to do business. And the auditoriums of the hotel were transformed into the site of political meetings of every stripe.”[^27] The Iurcoviches' Bauen was, according to researcher Alberto Bonnet,[^28] one of the places where Menem materialized his frivilous and consumerist ideology: “The nocturnal scenes of meetings in the fashionable nightclubs and restaurants—New York City, Trumps, The Sky, Hippopotamus, Misdeedor —in the most reserved five-star suites of the Alvear or Bauen hotels,” are among the elements that he points out were part of the Menemist cultural climate during his hegemony in the '90s.

Arminda left the hotel in 1983, but returned ten years later, still under the Iurcoviches as bosses. As was to be expected, those ten years outside of the establishment made him lose seniority. But, her peers who had stayed at the BAUEN would share the same fate. The business soon would begin to take evasive maneuvers against its social security obligations, which are a constant in asset stripping. María Eva Lossada, hotel worker and, as of the date of this publication, chairwoman of the BAUEN cooperative, tells how since the middle of the '90s, “there were changes to the registered name to evade taxes and avoid paying seniority, social expenses, and vacations to the personnel.” Her arrival at the hotel in 1994 was marked by a fact that impacted her on her first workday: “there was a group of people that had been fired, around twenty, and they were gathered in the doorway of the hotel.” As a punitive warning, making the replacements enter with the fired workers in full view was no small thing.

In María Eva, however, the result was not what the bosses expected.

The pressure on workers becomes more and more intense. As with the entire labor market at the time, conditions in the hotel and food industries were in place for deterioration standards and labor precarity. Workers had to accept whatever came their way, continues María Eva, “because, like he said, ‘there are 50 people outside waiting to replace you.’ They also started to outsource activities.” The number of workers was reduced to “a handful of 70 people who belonged to the hotel,” and the rest of employees started to be assigned to outsourced areas, like “the laundry, the public areas, the bar, the majority belonged to other management.” Iurcovich applied the manual on creating precarity to the letter, expelling workers, taking on new ones in worse conditions, changing the registered name to avoid accumulation of seniority, and outsourcing divisions to move employees from the hotel payroll to working for contractors who were really subsidiaries of their own business group (see box).

### Sale to Solari

Frequent changes to the registered name were a lead-up to the sale of the hotel to a Chilean businessman named Solari. It was the end of an ever-more obvious decline, and coincided with the collapse of Buenos Aires as hotel showcase, as another product of the economic policy that was sinking into recession and making the city very expensive in dollars for tourists. Competition from big international chains that were starting to show up in the country, with more modern and luxurious facilities, bagan to push the Bauen out of the center of the hotel scene.

At the beginning of 1997[^29], the tower at Callao 360 finally wound up in the hands of the “Chilean Solari group,” while the Iurcoviches held on to the BAUEN Suite and its other businesses. The sale, carried out February 24, 1997, was for twelve million peso-dollars, although in the end, Solari would only pay four million. Like everything related to the group's business, there is a lack of clarity in this operation.

At first glimpse, it looks like a skillful move by Iurcovich, who was getting out from under a hotel that, as he himself would admit to *Clarín*, needed updates and was losing market, which was due –in a curious self-forgiveness– “to wear from the passage of time and the lack of investments.”[^30] According to the same article, the BAUEN had already been relegated to the third category in the Argentine hospitality ranking by that time, working “with contingents of Brazilian and Chilean tourists who buy packages for well below the 145 pesos for double occupancy of the official rate.” Still, it is debatable whether this a matter of business acumen: the “Chilean Solari group” that Clarín mentions was not a group, but an individual, Félix Santiago Solari Morello, who was coming off several restaurant failures on the other side of the [Andean] mountain range. The only thing he sahred with the real Solari group, which owns the famous Falabella chain, was his last name (see box). The question that remains is whether Félix Solari really could have closed a deal of such magnitude.

For workers, the change in boss was a wake-up call that marked the beginning of the end. In María Eva's words:

> In '97, it was reported to us that this part was going to be sold, that the Bauen Tower was going to be divided from the Bauen Suite.[^31] They offered us severance money that was far less than what we were due. I said that I was going to think about it, and they answered me that I had until tomorrow, and that if I wanted to file suit against them, I might win after five or six years, and 'if you were going to be paid, you would be paid in installments.' I consulted with my husband (who was working at Polytechnics, which also belonged to Iurcovich) and we decided to sign up to file suit. But they made me sign before a scribe where I accepted all the proposed terms. Others made arrangements through the union. This served to give me more knowledge of our rights. I began to realize that doing my job in the best way was no guarantee of keeping it, that we could end up on the street at any time, that we were just numbers to them, we weren't people.

In the midst of the economic recession the country was going through, things got harder for the business in Solari's hands, and the prices of the rooms dropped from 120 dollars to around 70.[^32] Things were not going as expected, and Menem and Cavallo's convertibility model was winding down.


31 The Bauen hotel we referto in this book was also known as the Bauen Tower, a marketing name the Iurkoviches used to distinguish it from the Bauen Suite, the fantasy name for the hotel they still maintain on Callao avenue.

[^32]: Santiago Or’Donnell, ob. cit.

December 7, 1998, the BAUEN was selected by the Alliance between Radical Civic Unity and FREPASO to proclaim the presidential slate of Fernando de la Rúa and Carlos “Chacho” Álvarez, which would ultimately win the election in 1999. In those days, the hotel was also the site of meetings between a number of hierarchs in the *Justicialista* Party of Buenos Aires, who frequented its facilities so often they ended up becoming known as the Bauen Group.[^33] Meanwhile, Solari contributed a few worker dismissals from the hotel to unemployment statistics, and also reduced the hotel to the category of four stars. As if this was not enough, he began to accumulate debt by ABL to the GCBA, which, in 2005, was estimated at five million pesos. The decline was conspicuous.

For the business owners in the hotel sector, the summer of 1999 was the worst in ten years. The devaluation of the *real* stopped the flow of Brazilian tourists to Buenos Aires, and even though January and February are considered the low season in the city, it was already expected to be a difficult year.[^34]

### The Bauen closes its doors

The Bauen managed by Solari reached a crisis, and Iurcovich himself forced him to present a call of creditors (the first step in the mechanism in the Bankruptcy Law to resolve business insolvencies). A lien was placed by judge Rodolfo Herrera of the National Court on Civil and Commercial Affairs, no. 3, Sec. 5, which took 20% of the hotel's earnings. That put a financial chokehold on Solari, depriving him of the cash he needed to comply with his obligations to his creditors. That is how the Solari SA's legal agent, Gabriel Jaijel, explained it: “It was an emergency measure caused by a financial chokehold. Now, my client's wish is to come to an agreement with his creditors for liabilities that are around eight million pesos.”

The political and economic situation of the country was deteriorating rapidly with the government of the Alliance, whose crisis was accelerated when the Vice-President, Carlos Chacho Álvarez, resigned in October of 2000 in the fallout from the bribery scandal in the National Senate known as the “Banelco Law,” which was a law that made work precarious and advanced the destruction of labor rights. With bankruptcy decreed on February 22, 2001, management of the BAUEN passed into the hands of a trusteeship. “A trustee started to manage us. We made 50 pesos per week,” María Eva recalls. “By February of 2001, a trustee took charge of the hotel,” relates Horacio Lalli, another worker. “Two trustees really—one was an accountant, and the other I don't remember very well now, but I think he was a lawyer, and they carried out all the the managerial part of the hotel.”

[^33]: In the group Bauen there was leaders like Felipe Solá, Alberto Pierri and Luis Barrionuevo.

Recovered from http://past.eldia.com/editions/19990201/laciudad0.html

Another worker, Gladys Alegre, maintains that the trusteeship nothing did to stop asset-stripping: among other less obvious things, the furniture of the tower became part of the assets of the Bauen Suite. As Horacio points out, the fate of the Bauen business was, “as of that point, a chronicle of an announced death.” And Marcelo Ruarte, another historied cooperative member and its first president, reinforces the idea: “we were expecting the final blow, because, to tell the truth, there was no longer any movement. I mean, we knew that the hotel would be closing at any moment.”

The decline of the Bauen paralleled the decline of the country. The year 2001 was full of disastrous measures, starting with the ruinous business of the “Megaswap” of external debt, negotiated by (among others) Federico Sturzenegger, president of the Central Bank fifteen years later with Mauricio Macri. There was also the brutal attempt at adjustment in education that marked the brief tenure of Ricardo López Murphy in the Ministry of Economics, which was repudiated by enormous mobilizations of students and teachers. And then there was the resulting return to the economic guidance of the father of the whole crumbling mess, the creator of convertibility, Domingo Cavallo. In July of 2001, the newspapers reported that unemployment had reached 16.4%, a figured only exceeded by the 17.3% registered in 1996. Together with the announcement of “zero deficit” as an economic goal came a 13% cut to pensions and salaries of state employees, and a series of measures that were more and more unpopular, while things were getting worse: the pickets of the unemployed, mobilizations by different social and political sectors, and the widespread sense, soon corroborated by facts, that the country was picking up pace as it walked towards the abyss.

De la Rua resigned in December of 2001, when the economic measures imposed by Cavallo—especially “the *corralito*” that confiscated deposits and mainly affected the middle class, and, in a domino effect, the poorest sectors—were not able stop the crisis that led to the massive protests of December of 2001, for which the state of emergency decreed by the President himself served as the detonator. The social uprising and the unprecedented institutional crisis combined an enormous wave of looting by hungry crowds in suburban neighborhoods and in many cities with a massive mobilization of the middle and working classes in the capital shouting “Out with all of them!” It also forced the resignation, first of Domingo Cavallo (the night of December 19) and, several hours hours and 35 deaths later, of Fernando de la Rúa, who fled the Pink House in a helicopter flight that remains engraved in the tragic memory of the country.

Rodríguez Saá (the Peronist governor of the province of San Luis, who also learned how to weave alliances in the BAUEN around the year 2000), momentarily in charge of the presidency, declared that the country had entered into default with international credit organizations the 23rd of December. A short time later, he, in turn, left the government, in the rapid and chaotic succession of five presidents, culminating in the inauguration of Eduardo Duhalde, who had lost the elections of 1999 to the same De la Rua.

In the middle of this traumatic and unprecedented situation, the BAUEN closed its doors the 28th of December, like a bitter April Fools' Day joke. “I told a companion, ‘at least we have work’" María Eva says. "How naive I was! Because, on the 28th of December of 2001, they threw us all out without severance and without paying our wages, or vacations, or anything.”

In spite of all the indications of the general state of the country and of the accelerated decline of the business, the workers were left in a state of profound helplessness and a certain bewilderment by the loss of their jobs. “They were taking out comforters, curtains, beds, etc., a bunch of things, and we were saying, "what are we going to do?" We can't do anything. We can only go to the Trustee and tell him not to let them take any else, because they were stripping the place,” is how María Eva tells it.

The 28th of December, workers were clear they were unemployed as of that day. The climate was one of dismay, a sadness that seemed to have no possible solution, either inside or outside the doors of the hotel. Gladys recalls that, “on the 28th, we already knew about closure of the hotel. So, I left my house at six in the morning, because we started at seven. We arrived. The head of housekeeping made us make up the rooms that had to be made up. Some had already been dismantled.” This is not very different from what Marcelo lived through, having gone to work like every day, but that “each time we finished our shift, we went by the linens department to turn in our clothes.”

The final image comes from María Eva: “We greeted the 28th as if it was just another day, and then we were gripped by sadness. I didn't want to leave. I was on the eighth floor. I didn't want to leave.”

The scam was consumated, the BAUEN had been stripped, its workers fired without severance or any semblance of their rights being respected. Everything was disarray and hopelessness for them, and they walked out the door of the hotel convinced they would never walk back in, and that they were beginning a very difficult stage of their lives.

### SOLARI

Félix Santiago Solari Morello doesn't have anything to do with the Solari family (except perhaps his anti-communism and his sympathy for the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet),[^35] prominent members of the bourgeoisie of Chile. Together with families Cúneo and From the Río[^36], they control the ownership of the chain of Falabella businesses, which arrived in Argentina in 1993. It is probable that this happy coincidence of last name and nationality did not awaken suspicions in anyone who learned that, four years later, the BAUEN hotel passed into the hands of “the Chilean Solari group,” as the newspaper *Clarín*[^37] reported. Félix, who was fleeing lawsuits in his country, also came from another economic sector, food. Even after his failed hotel management, he continues in the same activity through the use of the Niña Bonita grill, which is located around the corner from the BAUEN, on Corrientes avenue[^38]. Another version, published in *Página/12*, maintains that Solari is not who exploits the grill but is, rather, exploited in it, which is to say, is employed.[^39] In any case, Solari's solvency when he signed the contracts with the Iurcoviches does not seem to have been guaranteed by anything more than his coincidental last name and national origin. Still, the Iurcoviches do not appear be very worried by these financial aspects as they close multi-million-peso agreements, if the dubious deal they made with Mercoteles is any indication.

## The takeover

The Bauen began its history as a recovered business March 21, 2003, a year and almost three months after its closure. Its workers had been left on the street in the middle of Argentina's biggest economic crisis in decades, a crisis that was also social and political, and the end did not seem to be anywhere in sight.

The year 2002 had been convulsive: mobilizations every day, exponential growth of the picket movement and neighborhood assemblies, while savings account holders scammed by the “*corralito*” pounded on banks, and bartering had become a medium of exchange for subsistence. The murder of Darío Santillán and Maximiliano Kosteki on the 26th of June on Pueyrredón Bridge had set the stage for the departure of Eduardo Duhalde and, by the beginning of 2003, a confusing electoral campaign took place, in which there was hardly any distinction between the five leading candidates. A short time later, with Carlos Menem declining to compete in the elction, Néstor Kirchner would come to power with a degree of political weakness rarely seen in a recently elected president, having won only 22% of the votes.

Meanwhile, a new movement had developed and become visible: the movement of businesses recovered by their workers. While its background dated to the early '90s, notable cases like Zanon [*a ceramics factory*], IMPA [*metalworking and plastics factory*], Chilavert [*print shop*], and Brukman [*clothing factory*] had made it visible to a good part of society. Its defense of jobs in factories and businesses that had been stripped and abandoned by their former owners had given it recognition, and more importantly, legitimacy. In a society in which work had become a scarce and much-desired resource, the struggle to continue working was valued by a large majority of society, and the workers who occupied bankrupt businesses achieved enough success to pressure functionaries and legislators. The most noteworthy result of that capacity for pressure was the passage of expropriation laws, as happened with Brukman, Chilavert, and Ghelco, among others, in the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires, a few months before the takeover of the Bauen. This did not mean that the issue was easy to resolve—quite the opposite—but some mechanisms were in place, and doors had been opened through the mobilization of organized workers, mostly in the National Movement of Recovered Businesses (MNER).

One of the main demands of this movement, by then, was the reform of the bankruptcy law, which had been modified during the government of Carlos Menem according to the dictates of the IMF, turning it into a mere mechanism for the liquidation of businesses. The law facilitated business asset stripping (a crime that existed in the prior law and was deleted in this reform) and prioritized the auction of goods and payment to creditors over the preservation of jobs and continuity of economic use. It was legislation at the service of the destruction of industrial equipment and jobs. This law would be of great importance in the legal trouble the Iurcoviches had caused in the bankruptcy of the Bauen.

### The former employees of the Bauen connect with the MNER

While close to a hundred factories and establishments of all kinds were working or in a struggle for recovery by different methods, the Bauen hotel remained closed and boarded up with a fence covering the whole front on Callao avenue. Most of its furniture and equipment for daily work as a hotel had been disappearing, even though supposedly the bankrupt business was under guard. The former employees, who still held out hope that they would at least be paid back wages and severance, soon began to raise the alarm that the asset stripping was significant, and the goods were being transferred to the Iurcoviches' other hotel (which never was sold), the BAUEN Suite, around the corner on Corrientes avenue, through a hall that connected both buildings underground.

María Eva recalls:

> Everything started in the offices of the trustee, where we went to demand what was owed to us. There, we found out that they were taking all the furniture out of the hotel, and then we decided to hold out to avoid it. A guy who was a telephonist told us that there was a movement that recovered businesses by way of their workers. At first, we didn't trust them, but after the first meetings in (the cooperative) Chilavert, we saw that they were very well informed, and that recovery was possible. The hard part was convincing the others. At this point, there were eight or ten of us.

The contact with the MNER was made by one of the workers who were contining to demand the wages they were due from the trustee in charge of the bankruptcy, Gustavo Alaluf. When some of the former employees of the hotel met up at the City Bank located on Corrientes and Uruguay to receive a payment of AR$200 out of what they were owed (it was the only time), he commented to the others that “there was a movement that recovers businesses.” This was something that, in María Eva's words, seemed "crazy" to them at first. In spite of that, a meeting was soon scheduled with the movement, in the facilities of a recovered print shop, Chilavert Arts Printing, in the neighborhood of Pompei. 

The Chilavert cooperative (called Gaglianone before its recovery), had gone through a hard recovery process in 2002. Its eight workers who survived the asset-stripping had taken over the workshop in April to prevent the machines being taken, after noticing a scheme between the boss and the trustee. A large mobilization of neighborhood assemblies and other recovered businesses (above all, IMPA, which was then the flagship of the movement, and which parked a truck in the doorway to keep the police from coming in) had prevented the eviction ordered by a judge. The takeover was sustained for eight months until the passage of an expropriation law in the Legislature of Buenos Aires consolidated the cooperative's recovery.

So, Chilavert was an ideal place for the former Bauen workers to begin to join together with a view to an eventual recovery. This seemed absolutely unreal, initially. Arminda says that, “one day, my *compañeros* called me and told me that they were going to hold some assemblies to take over the hotel, because they had connected with a group of people, which is the (National) Movement of Recovered Businesses. I asked them if I was going to do them any good, because I was already an old person. And they told me yes, don't worry about anything, they needed my support and they really wanted us all to get together, a group of people, and to please spread the word that the assembly was going to be held, so all those who were interested should come to that first assembly to see what could be done, because we ourselves didn't know anything about laws. We were tremendously afraid.”

In that first meeting, hotel employees found themselves with MNER activists and workers from several already recovered businesses. Eduardo “Basque” Murúa, a leader at IMPA and president of the MNER, led the meeting. Eva recalls the presence of others were there, too: José Abelli, vice-president of the organization; Fabio Resino, who would later have a leading role in the history of the BAUEN; and the hosts, Cándido González and Plácido Peñarrieta, among others who formed the leadership and most committed base of the movement at the time. Gladys says that “there were eight, nine people on a corner, at La Plata Avenue and Caseros. That was when we met up for the first time, when we went to the meeting at Chilavert.” When Murúa asked them if they were in a condition to take over the BAUEN, Gladys answered him that no, that they'd be beaten, that it was impossible. “The Basque” and Cándido González, one of the Chilavert workers, told them that it was not at all impossible, that it could be done, because they had already done it in their respective businesses. Gladys says: "And they explained to us what a recovered business was, they explained to us how IMPA was started, how Chilavert was started. Starting then, those of us who were there felt stronger. And we told them yes. I added that if we had to take over the BAUEN, we had to take it over today, because the owners were going to find out and were going to have police put inside, and we weren't going to be able to get in. Then he told me no, not at that time, because we didn't have the people to get in.

That was the decisive moment hen, with help of the MNER, the hotel workers started to see it as a viable objective to recover the building at Callao 360 to go back to work. Several meetings were held, and the group started to get bigger. Gladys says that they resorted to “a small lie,” and started to convene their colleagues on the pretext that the trustee was going to pay them another part of what they were owed. The “small lie” was “out of fear, or maybe out of some insignificant thing, but for me, at that time, it was very important, an adventure I'd never imagined or dreamed of. And since then, we've been in the struggle.” 

The call went out for the 21st of March, 2003, at the corner of Callao and Corrientes.

### The takeover

The former Bauen employees met on the morning of March 21st at the corner of the hotel. They were not alone. About a hundred people accompanied them, convened by the National Movement of Recovered Businesses. There, they were advised that the purpose of the call was not to be paid money by the trustee, but to occupy the hotel. It was not a surprise or anything unimagineable to those who were not aware of the true plans, since after all, it was what they had been talking about in prior meetings. Although, Arminda supposes, “if he (Murúa) told us the reality of things, we would not have come, because your family is not going to let you take risks.”

The date was not random. The MNER had reports that the information about the intentions to occupy the hotel already had reached Iurcovich. “We had to take over the hotel that day, no matter what, because the owner had already found out, and before he warned the police, we had to do it,” continues Arminda. Murúa told them, she says, that was “now or never.” It was the decisive moment, and the MNER had managed to anticipate to any repression on the part of the bosses.

The front entrnce on Callao avenue was totally boarded up, which is why, since workers knew about the passage between the BAUEN Suite and the Bauen Tower, they decided enter by the least expected place, which is to say, through the interior of the establishment that still working and in the hands of the Iurcoviches—the BAUEN Suite. The whole group went to the door on Corrientes, to the surprise of employees of the Bauen Suite, using the old employee entrance (Arminda says that, before, all workers, whether they worked in one tower or the other, entered there) and found themselves in the corridor that connects both buildings, closed with a simple door with a small lock. And she continues explaining:

> It was at that moment [continues Arminda] that the people who most supported all of us and the workers here at the Bauen entered on Corrientes (…). It was a little lock. They opened the lock, and we went inside. It was such joy –we walked into the lobby– when we saw that the power was on! Obviously, we didn't think we were going to have power. So, we hugged each other, we started to cry. They [the MNER activists] are so practical...! They opened the door, a tiny, little door because that everything was boarded up, everything was totally boarded up. They opened a door and well, at that point, you see that all the TV stations and journalists had already been notified. It was endless people!

In María Eva's story, we also hear the emotion of that entry, something that hadn't even been a dream months before. But we also hear the concern for the state the facilities were in. There was electricity, but the neglect was significant. “The only thing that made us happy was that we had lights. Otherwise, was everything a disaster—dirty, abandoned, no furniture, boarded up. We made a hole in the boards to be able go out to Callao street.” Marcelo Ruarte also describes the state of the hotel as “a nest of rats and cockroaches,” which is why the neighbors were actually happy about the occupation, because the workers would remove that source of infestation from the block.

Marcelo Iurcovich's intention was obviously not to leave the hotel abandoned, but to wait for a change in the economic situation of the country to decide whether to put it back in service, sell it, or do some other kind of business. This, of course, could not be established in any statement of his, but rather, from his actions. Because, while he had supposedly not been in possession of the Bauen since 1997, the connection with the BAUEN Suite around the corner was as obvious as the ease with which the workers and the MNER had been able to cross the passage between the two buildings. The furniture on the Callao side had been taken out through the Suite, which is why when the hotel was occupied, one of the conditions for reopening was putting back all that was lacking. And, importantly, Iurcvich had pulled his umpteenth slight of hand, in which the ownership of the hotel was back in his hands under yet another business name, Mercoteles, a decisive issue we will return to later.

Any doubt about the relationship that Marcelo Iurcovich had with the BAUEN was cleared up shortly after the workers occupied the building. The police report about the takeover of the hotel was written at the BAUEN Suite. The businessman himself showed up at the hotel accompanied by the police. “The police came with Iurcovich,” relates María Eva. “Not just any police—the Commissioner was there, the sub-commissioner, the highest ranks.” Also with them was the bankruptcy trustee, who had no choice but to ratify that the intruders “were us, the former workers, that we'd been after them to pay us, that they knew us well.” María Eva continues:

> We explained our points of view to them, because the compañeros of the MNER had prepared us. The trustee also showed up, and we told him to do an inventory of what they had left and compare it with the one done on the day of the closure. The commissioner asked him if he knew us. He told him yes. Diego Kravetz (at that time, the MNER's lawyer[^40]) was detained for several hours, and that was all for the moment.

One of issues with the trustee was the inventory of goods, because if it was done at the end of the occupation, they could be accused of having taken anything that was missing. Finally, an inventory was done of everything in the hotel at the time of the occupation, and the bankruptcy judge ended up giving the former workers provisional possession of the property. This resolution, despite its finite duration, served to give legal coverage to the first months of the takeover.

The arrogance of a businessman used to doing what he wants and to looking down on his workers was obvious in his final exchange with the occupiers. Eva continues: “Marcelo Iurcovich told us, mockingly, to stay, that it would be cheaper for him than a security company, and that if we could make it operate, then we should work there.” He was in for a surprise, and even more so his son and heir, Hugo, since Marcelo would pass away a short time later.

[^40]: Diego Kravetz was the MNER's lawyer and activist in business recovery at the time. Soon after this, he became a Deputy in the legislature of Buenos Aires for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, led by Miguel Bonasso. His political career rather quickly led him to abandon not only the issue of recovered businesses, but also his ability to distiguish between various political stances, drifting from supporting Kirchner to the *Frente Renovator*, and finally winding up as Secretary of Security to the Mayor of Lanús, Néstor Grindetti, of the PRO. In that political cartwheeling, he went from being arrested for occupying businesses to being an “expert in insecurity.”

## Holding on

Taking over the hotel was simple compared with the long period of resistance immediately afterwards, which the workers usually call *el aguante*, “the holding on.” They found themselves inside an immense building, in a state of total abandonment, in no condition to work. The door on Callao Avenue was boarded up, the furniture had disappeared, and every part of the hotel needed to be repaired and cleaned before they could even start to think about recovering the hotel as such.

“At that point, we started to ask for money on the street with a can, and to go around with our little basket to all the universities and all the high schools, and marches, and so we survived,” says Gladys about that time. Far from discouraging them, their circumstances pushed them to immediately begin fixing up the place to be able to work, and to prepare a place where they could stay, more or less comfortably, in the difficult months that awaited them. That was the beginning of what Gladys considered the most difficult stage they went through. Sometimes they did not even have decent meals, with all there was to do and without knowing very well how to do it.

The first legal action was to create a worker cooperative with the former hotel workers who had met and carried out the takeover, of whom there were seventeen, for the moment. The cooperative was called Callao, taking the name of the avenue the BAUEN is on, which is common in recovered businesses (for example, the Chilavert cooperative, formerly Gaglianone; the Vieytes cooperative, formerly Ghelco, etc.). Gustavo Alaluf was chosen as president. However, this structure did not last long. Once the occupation of the hotel was over, and the effort to put it to work began, other former workers started to approach, until their numbers reached around 30, most of whom were still owed money by the old enterprise, whether under the registered name of Solari or Bauen SACIC. A difference emerged among them, because Alaluf intended for the founders of the cooperative to become employers of the rest, which created arguments both among the workers and in the MNER. This controversy did not last long, and finally the majority decided to adopt the egalitarian criterion that prevailed in the other recovered businesses, dissolve the Callao cooperative and form a new one, called *Buenos Aires, Una Empresa Nacional* [Buenos Aires, A National Business], because its initials were a play on the name of the hotel. In the new co-op, no distinction was made between those who first joined the cooperative and those who came later, whether or not they were former workers at the Bauen[^41]. Marcelo Ruarte was elected president of the new cooperative by acclamation.

Meanwhile, the first days in the hotel were used to clean the building and start to bring it up to minimum standards, if only to have a bit of comfort for the occupation. These were hard times, in which the occupiers went out on the street with a box to ask for collaboration from passers-by to sustain the takeover and their own subsistence. While some had jobs they had to keep to guarantee some income for their families, like Gladys, who was working nights in a *remissions, other *compañeros* had no choice but to get the necessary resources by means of creativity and imagination, including appealing to people's solidarity.

From there, with the disputes overcome, the “holding on” was organized better, with tasks distributed according to people's capacities and availability of time. The first thing that occurred to them was that all the available unused and wasted material could get a little money. They contacted a depository of recyclable materials to see what could be rescued.

There was lots of old folders, useless papers, irons that couldn't be fixed, ruined mattresses, and other objects left over from the furniture. Some people pulled the wire frames out the folders to salvage the iron, others baled paper and cardboard, with whom some were leaving a “cartonear” to increase the income. Also, through the MNER were made efforts before State, which let them access some subsidies. This served them to have some revenue minimal and receive boxes of food of first need.

[^41]: The publisher of the daily *La Nación* of the 14 of March of 2017 accuses a the members of the cooperative of “violate patent laws” by using the initial BAUEN. At its defense corporate of the businesspeople, the newspaper does not know before that workers used the initial the same Iurcovich changed of registered name in various occasions.

The MNER continued being a key actor in this period. Some of their activists were permanently in the hotel, assesing and collaborating with the group. The other recovered businesses supported their solidarity and some resources, that no les were left over. The Argentina, a recovered bakery by their workers, donated to them bread and the bills that were left over of the day prior for breakfasts and snacks. The cooperative The Cacerola, recent formada,[^42] too provided them hot food in the periods of cold. For cover up, the women sewed blankets. Advancing the winter, the hotel without heat was a freezer.

By that time some half helped spread the problem of the hotel, what les facilitated the contacts in solidarity with other organizations. Others, instead, how “the Negro” González Oro in the Radio 10, attacked them accusing them of usurpers of private property, something that through others journalists of the hegemonic half would be repeated frequently throughout history of the cooperative.

### The first event: of recovered a recovered

“Meanwhile we put in conditions the rooms to be able to work. This took us about a year, until we had our first client, the fifteenth birthday of the daughter of the fellow Plácido (of the cooperative Chilavert). Starting from there we begin with the veiled in the rooms. Sacábamos hardly to replenish merchandise and eat,” remembers Gladys of this difficult period.

Plácido Peñarrieta, worker and president of the print shop Chilavert, was about to party the fifteenth birthday of your daughter Rosalía. “I would kill two birds with one stone,” commented the same Plácido: solve the problem of the place to the party and at the same time collaborate with the workers of the BAUEN.

“In the 2003 my daughter turned fifteen and I wanted throw her a party,” tells Plácido, years later. The recovery of the Bauen gave him to this worker graphic with long militancy previous in the movement villero an opportunity to make up for the forced absences that the militancy and the confrontational stage forced. The pressure of the lack of revenue when close work is, possibly, the strongest that feel workers, something that is part of the story of a enormous majority of members of recovered businesses –and further if it's about workers– when count the recovery process in their stages more complicated, when there's no money to cover the most basic needs of the family.

[^42]: The Cooperative The Cacerola isn't has its origin in a company prior but rather in the commission of unemployed of the assembly of Plaza Almagro, but was part at that time of the MNER. Currently is associated with FACTA.

“I with my family felt a large debt all the needs for which passed and for all the moments that no I was able be with them,” continues Plácido, that remembers:

> When my daughter had fourteen years I promised myself that le was going to do the party of fifteen. But me there was born other son and the thing se had put more difficult in economic aspects. The nene is born in January of 2003 and me found how in the air, pulled everywhere and did not comply well with my functions of head of family, or here, either, the lack of resources me was cornering. My despair by cumplirle came because never le we had celebrated a birthday, always there was others expenses most important, always was work, work. So one is lost many moments of enjoy with the family, of being with the children in important moments. Me gave a lot of squabbling the heresy of the bosses that steals even that from us, the pleasure of be with our children.

The idea that emerged as “crazy” started to take shape in the most unexpected way. The group that had begun to meet in their own cooperative without having idea of what was a recovered business now was occupying one of the hotels most important of Buenos Aires, with various rooms where make a party. He continues Plácido:

In that time contact with the BAUEN was constant, was of fraternity and solidarity in all aspects, was a give and take permanent. I remember that when we entered by force al hotel in the 2003 and saw those rooms abandoned, dreamed of recover them for be able to do there the party of my daughter. But was a dream how when we dreamed here the day on which we were working to us, with a print shop in our hands. But as well as this last was fulfilled, too happened the other.

was formed then a combination of wills: on the one hand, that of Plácido by organize the birthday of your daughter although didn't have resources, trying get of the solidarity of various sectors, and by another, the of the workers of the BAUEN cooperative, no longer only to give him a satisfaction a a fellow that had helped them to recover the hotel, but as reason to return to to value rooms, kitchen and other parts of the building, and put them a they themselves a proof of that were able to undertake your functions without the bosses. The organization of that party was a key moment.

The truth that seeing it objectively seemed impossible, We were everyone without a chuck, persecuted by the police, the rooms after a year of closed were in so terrible conditions that condition them in so little time seemed impossible. With the peers of the BAUEN we decided to carry forward the project, we begin in April and for (then) my family already se had put more dense, since yet nothing was resolved. So went forming how a melody, in that each one contributed a note, a fellow mí me gave the sound, other the video, the BAUEN put the room and the waiters, a recovered bakery mí me gave the cake, here we made a little cow for some expenses more and so the melody was completed in time. At some point before the party the group of waiters, that us there was given the service, met in a circle and one of them says ‘this is our trial by fire, everything has to go well no matter what, a put everything’. They were like the soccer players before of the party meet everyone to be given mood. That suprised me and made me emotional, by how they took it, as a challenge, to be demonstrated what they were capable of and se had to look good.

The party was done at the beginning of October of 2003, and was the return of activities themselves of the area of hospitality and gastronomy al building of Callao 360, this time without the boss. As says Plácido:

The bitter part about no power satisfy enough during a year a the needs of the family was mixed with lo sweet of power pay that debt having with my daughter thanks to the solidarity of all the peers. So I went down in history as the first client of the BAUEN cooperative.

Thanks to the solidarity of workers and students, members of the Cooperative were able to survive the first year of occupation together with that they hurried the reconditioning of the facilities of the hotel. The effort carried out in these moments stayed registered in images of the documentary of Fabián Pierucci, BAUEN. Struggle, culture and work, in the interviews to the workers in those moments, between them one in which is seen a Gladys and Arminda making they themselves, with their sewing machine, napkins to equip the hotel. Capital is accumulation based on the exploitation of labor, and in the BAUEN workers invested their labor force directly, to be able come back to create the business that employed them, this time in a collective form. It is self-exploitation? It may be, but the issue becomes abstract when is struggling for survival and se bet on a future of self-management.

## The recovered hotel

If the birthday of Rosalía Peñarrieta was point key for enable the rooms for events, was missing make lo own with the rooms, which is to say, with the hotel properly said. In spite of the efforts of the workers of the cooperative, a year after the occupation still was not in conditions of accommodate passengers.

To the hotel rooms of twenty stories was missing furniture, sheets, reparations, hot water, paint, etc. All that was being done little by little, story by story. To rehabilitate the rooms, instead, was simpler.

Also, the decision was made to remove the woods that covered the front and face too the opening of the bar on the ground floor, a project that was going to require funds but that too would have to be capable of create them relatively quick, al create a possible entry of revenue in the form constant.

Removed part of the screens that covered the front, to facilitate the income of the clients, the rooms started to be rented for different activities. From a little, the BAUEN started to become the BAUEN cooperative, the hotel of the workers. The rooms were reactivated, finishing the stage of the “holding on” to begin recovery as a establishment hotelier and gastronomic.

Gladys highlights in these moments a the peers of different hospitals that carried out there birthday, meetings, conferences, courses and other activities that required of a place wide. To theater group Uruguayan used the auditorium for their spectacles. Those representations lasted approximately a year and, also, after each acting was prepared for them a lunch, what helped that se empezara with gastronomic activities which culminated in the habilitación of the bar on the ground floor.

Also the association of tattoos Tattoo started to carry out your meetings and national conventions and international. “It helped us a lot, because us occupied everyone the rooms, were big events,” mentions Gladys.

Also the guild of teachers became regulate client. Starting from there started the recovery of the work, which was never going to stop. In of December, proudly, were carried the first retreat of 200 pesos and a little box with food for the parties.

The mere fact of the existence of an occupied hotel in the very center of the City of Buenos Aires quickly turned al BAUEN on a polo of political activities and guild. The own MNER started to use the rooms for meetings and assemblies. The 11 October of 2003, for example, was held a debate about legislation for the recovered businesses, led by “the Basque” Murúa, José Abelli and the lawyer Diego Kravetz (already Deputy elect), al that were invited various jurists, even some not too prone to social movements how Daniel Sabsay. The chat took place in the auditorium, and to reach there yet se should have cross a space covered average by the woods that covered part of the entryway and hid sectors still in reparations or to be repaired.

Since then would no longer be members of the national business class, or high mandos military, or politicians representatives of the interests of the great corporations who would give life to the hotel or they would swarm by their rooms to seal strategic alliances, but social organizations and popular las that they were going to be welcomed in the rooms and places of meeting of the building of Callao. The BAUEN cooperative started to have a new centrality in the political life of the country and of the city, constituting the reverse of the Bauen employer and accomplice of the dictatorship and the menemismo.

Also work began on the rehabilitation of the bar. The old Bauen had a bar on the ground floor, but without exit to the street. That bar returned a function for the activities that started to become within the establishment, but still seperated it a tapia of access a Callao avenue. Some collectives began to meet there. For example, the group that was forming the magazine Question Latin American (a publication based in Venezuela) and that then rented for a time offices in the hotel, or the program UBACyT of Transfer Scientific-Technological for Recovered Businesses, formed among others by the Open Faculty Program of the School of Philosophy and Letters and representatives of others faculties of the UBA, how Engineering and Social Sciences. workers the former Zanon and current FASINPAT (Factory Without Bosses) collaborated giving the ceramics and in the middle of 2004 was acheived open the bar a the street, which was another source of revenue for the cooperative in the long path to reconstruct work. The bar was called Utopia.

Soon too were located in the BAUEN other projects. On the front of Callao, with exit to the new bar, was installed too a bookstore, that was there some years. During a quarter were given classes of the Language Laboratory of the School of Philosophy and Letters of the UBA. Se made training courses for workers and activists of the MNER. And countless initiatives that had acceptance in their rooms.

By that time too was developed other large conflict for the recovery of several plants of the business Gatic SA, licensee in Argentina of Adidas and other brands of clothes and shoemaking deportivo43. In the town of Saint Martín, the workers of one of his plants were able to their expropriation and were formed how Cooperative United by the Shoemaking (CUC). With the support of a Foundation that was formed taking as a reference the celebrated film of Canadians Naomi Klein and Avi Lewis on the Argentine recovered businesses (The Take, in Castillian The takeover), workers of CUC started the project of a mark of shoemaking own and launched it in the BAUEN. They installed in the lobby of the hotel, to the left of the entry of Callao, a small position where were exhibited and sold the different models of zapatillas manufactured by the cooperative.

The other large plant that was acheived recover of Gatic became the Cooperative Textiles Pigüé. The conflict of Pigüé was prolonged and hard, and al be in a locale to almost 600 kilometers of the capital their workers had to spend whole days in Buenos Aires, first for meetings and negotiations to bring about the recovery of his factory and, after recovered, to maintain tasks commercial needed for its operation. The BAUEN was always the site where se were able to shelter in challenging times, and in which se kept hosting when the cooperative started to become a prosperous textile business recovered. To the today, Textiles Pigüé keeps using the BAUEN.

### The Great Homeland

The breaking point between the prolonged period of “holding on,” the first activities and liftoff in the reactivation hotel could become by solidarity of the Bolivarian government of Venezuela. To this moment, principles of the year 2004, had not been managed reestablish the ability to provide housing. To do so had to get minimal resources to be able enable the use of at least one of the stories. were still lacking some implements essential. As well as the rooms started to be used through the party of the daughter of Plácido, the rooms lo were beginning with the momentum decisive given by the visit of a orchestra children's and youth of Venezuela.

By that time, the government of Hugo Chávez had managed to overcome two ferocious attempted coups d'etat. The first, of the type “classic,” was developed April of 2002: the president was briefly deposed from office and retained by military forces on a naval base, being the try overthrown by popular mobilization and of loyal forces. The second was a brutal sabotage economic that paralyzed the main source of revenue of the country, the business petroleum company state PDVSA, between purposes of the same year and the first months of 2003. It was fairly PDVSA which financed the operation that meant the start-up definitive of the recovery of the BAUEN, paying in advance the housing of a symphonic orchestra childish that would visit Argentina in October of 2004.

The relationship between the process Bolivarian in Venezuela and our country was going through a moment of growth and narrowing of ties, both at the governmental level how popular. The coup attempts of sectors traditionally powerful, supported by the right and the United States, finished of leave in clear to many that Chavismo was a process of wide base popular and of anti-imperialist ideology and that more and more clearly expressed himself in favor of a new kind of socialism, the “socialism of the twenty-first century.” Hugo Chávez there was visited Argentina as president in May of 2003, when the assumption of Néstor Kirchner, and since that time did so on several more occasions, until the culminating moment that was the Summit of Mar del Plata, in November of 2005, in that happened by land with the project of the Area of Free Trade of the Americas (ALCA).

In the middle of 2004, exchange between both countries was in quick growth and some meetings of solidarity with Venezuela were made in the BAUEN, which made possible a direct relationship between the cooperative and that which then was ambassador Venezuelan in Argentina, Freddy Balzán.

María Eva remembers that moment:

> The Venezuelans when they were looking for housing for bring a retinue they spoke with us, but the hotel yet was very ugly.had been taken out the tapiado of the before, but the rooms were not enabled. We tell him the history of the hotel, that we were a cooperative, but we in that time we didn't have the elements sufficient, they could help us if advanced us payment of the housing. In the end no wine the retinue, but yes did so the boys of a orchestra childish, boys that came from the villas, of the street.

It was about the Orchestra young Arcos of Venezuela directed no less than for a then practically unknown (and today famous worldwide) Gustavo Dudamel, of hardly 22 years, that was part of the National System of Orchestras Children and Youth of Venezuela led by other recognized teacher, José Antonio Abreu44.

For Marcelo Ruarte, who then was president the cooperative, the hiring of services that in 2004 did the government of Venezuela was fundamental. Marcelo remembers that the Venezuelans:

(…) needed shelter some 60 boys that, through a State program, recruited on the street, the vocalized and the they located then in large orchestras. Those boys were the first whom we shelter, after the sum of money that put PDVSA, thanks to the decision of their controller in Argentina, Alejandro Gómez, that allowed us put working two stories, four telephone lines, improve the lobby and buy vajilla, sheets and uniform.

So it was that, at the beginning of October of 2004, the almost 70 children of the orchestra directed by Dudamel were housed in two of the stories recent rehabilitated of the BAUEN. With payment advanced, remembers María Eva that bought (…) the elements of bed that were needed and also, in turn, clothing for the (workers of the) stories, reception, maids, etc. There was the opening of story. It was like a push that we needed so that commercially start to work the stories.

The push was so big that even included the purchase of some plants for beautify the entryway. And the drive did not stop more, was the start-up that it was necessary to put in career the resumption of the activity hotel.

### A hotel underway

At the beginning of 2006, little more than a year later of the visit of the orchestra Venezuelan, the BAUEN hotel was working a pure. As constata an article of Lavaca, had grown “of 35 a 140 members that during the 24 hours maintain a pure the functioning of the hotel, the auditorium, the coffeeshop, the bookstore and the rooms for events. Works theater, emissions radio with a large audience, cycles musical and writings of art they formed part of the programming of the year 2005. Also was headquarters of international events, how the discussion of art Ex Argentina, organized by the Goethe Institut or the Fair Cultural, organized by the Embassy of Venezuela."[^45]

The growth was staggering, but absolutely explainable beginning with the sacrifice and of the imagination of the members a the cooperative to reconstruct and also create most of their job. were rented rooms, were housed events, were received passengers, but also preyed spaces and opportunities were given. One of these expressions was, for example, the creation of an area of press, responsible of the management of public relations and dissemination of the development of the cooperative in key politics and social before commercial. The which led forward the “press of the BAUEN,” that contributed enormously to give the recovered hotel part of the global fame who has was Federico Tonarelli, one of the current concerning of the cooperative and president of the Argentine Federation of Self-Managed Worker Cooperatives (FACTA), which since its formation around those same years is chaired by the BAUEN cooperative.

Federico was a activist who collaborated actively with the MNER already before join the BAUEN and accompanied since early 2005 a Fabio Resino in the development of the cooperative. Quickly, was in charge of the press and also of manage with his father, Juan Carlos Tonarelli, the reactivation of the old print shop of the hotel to be able guarantee the printed and photocopying that demanded the functioning administrative more and more complex of the BAUEN. Tonarelli father had story in the old cooperative movement, and after a time of “soften,” they convinced him to install their center of copied within the hotel. “So Fabio (Resino) tells me ‘the BAUEN had a print shop why don't you come with your old and set up the printing press there in the hotel?’, tells Federico, that se explaya:

I come one day to see that, because already before knew the hotel. I come, we see the subsoil and was perfect. There was stayed a duplicator old, a Rotaprint. So Marcelo (Ruarte) says “dale Fede, tell your old, convince him.”

[^45]: “The recovered factories by their workers. Case witness: the Hotel Bauen (city of Buenos Aires),” portal Lavaca, 23 of March of 2006. Recovered from http://www.lavaca.org/notes/las-you manufacture-recovered businesses-bauen/

Although initially a Juan Carlos it seemed to him “crazy” install with their small print shop in an occupied hotel, after several months was convinced. That the copy center started to function, almost exclusively for the cooperative, was a sample of that the thing began to function, and better all the time, despejando the fears of Tonarelli father, who (…) armó a list of prices for the cooperative that was unbeatable, with a bonus very important, that functioned as payment by the physical space that they gave him/her for bring things. And what did I do while we had the workshop graphic? It was the runner, rose requests, sold on the street. Of course, al come here we started to do less that I work. So the printing press became almost as a whole the printing press of the hotel and with very few customers that us were being and finally I end up joining the cooperative and my parents end in the workshop printing everything for the BAUEN. So the BAUEN had their print shop until my old man passed away, but finished being one more of us. To my old man they really came to love him a lot here.

They were symptoms of a economic activity that was taking off, a cooperative that was moving. And no only in economics. As pointed out verifiably Lavaca, “(…) the hotel Bauen is characterized, fundamentally, by provide with solidarity spaces for social organizations that meet there to debate, organize and give to get to know your practices and needs.” In those first years, the BAUEN became a center of struggle, solidarity and mobilization. That quality, logically facilitated by their location strategic and for his functionality how establishment especially intended for meetings and social activities (no, of course, of nature and with the protagonists that had and they have), contributed to the defense of the cooperative was constituted in a common cause a for many people and organizations.

Of course, the ends pursued by the new administration and the modes of organization and decision were far removed from those of the previous efforts employers. This was not lost on a medium that systematically opinó and activó against the hotel workers (and against the working class in general):

By contacts with the delegate of the line E, Roberto Pianelli, the picketers approached the idea of developing the assemblies and press conferences in the hotel Bauen. Since there commands a worker cooperative the BAUEN became the place of political meetings.

Few marches are decided outside of that place. Unemployed, leaders guild of parties on the left and organizations of human rights encounter there a natural meeting place.[^46] The description belongs to a chronicle of the daily *La Nación* that gave an account of the processes of struggle and organization that in February of 2005 united leaders of different political organizations and social around the fight that carried forward the “metrodelegados” (“a guild grassroots more inclined to the left that al peronismo,” according to the characterization carried out by the same journalist), body of delegates from workers of the underground that were organized outside of the bureaucratic Unity Tranviarios Automotor (UTA) and that gave way, through a prolonged struggle, a the current Association Union of Workers of the Subway and the Premetro. Notwithstanding, the chronicle of the daily La Nación desliza falsehood by saying that “since there commands a worker cooperative the BAUEN became the place of political meetings,” overlooking the innumerable meetings and acts that in the times of employer management celebrated there the main political parties. That is, when were in charge the businesspeople, the BAUEN already was a “place of political meetings.” What has changed is composition and orientation of class of those celebrate there your meetings and the type of objectives that pursue the respective alliances.

The newspaper *La Nación*, anyway, was not at all wrong about the characterization. In the case particular of the metrodelegados, the BAUEN was in fact a key place to facilitate their organization. “Beto” Pianelli, Néstor Segovia and other activists that they formed that first attempt to the workers of the put in to build their organization with autonomy of the bureaucracy of the UTA have said numerous times the paper which had the BAUEN resulting in the meetings and assemblies on which was organized the new union. Even, the patota of the UTA attacked to delegates within the hotel, causing injuries a their workers and destruction materials. But everything was vain, the metrodelegados they did not give up of their purposes, they did not panic faced with these facts and were able to be consolidated. 

Since then, bonds between them and the workers of the BAUEN are so solid that even have reached threaten with unemployment of the underground faced with the threats of eviction suffered by the cooperative. It's about, properly, of class solidarity in action.

## The return of those who never left: the Iurcoviches reappear

ara the middle of 2005, as we've seen, the workers of the BAUEN cooperative had achieved put in foot, with enormous effort, the great hotel abandoned by the employers. The boarded up building and vacuum a couple of years earlier had been filled with life and work thanks to the cooperative.

In the expropriation bill presented to the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires in June of that year by the Deputy Kravetz was made a small balance of what had been accomplished. The enumeration of the project constata that, in two years of management, the cooperative had been able to:

(…) recover 115 jobs; put in conditions 160 rooms of the 224[^47]; renew the whole system of pipes of hot and cold water; recondition the seven rooms used for events and the theater; reinstall the whole network of telephony and put a new information network; put again working the elevators; expand and modernize the bar that was internal and aho47 In reality, the rooms of the hotel are 220.

ra has two stories a the street; and the change in the facade of the hotel by the works of maintenance and the bar.

This extraordinary result serves to contrast the performance of the cooperative with the of the businesspeople, above all if we compare the resources of that had one and other. While the Iurcoviches had served in tray a loan enough to face construction from zero and the opening of five-star hotel, provided by public bank, workers they couldn't access any credit, but a some subsidies that were not sufficient to open the hotel (already we saw that that was acheived with contribution from the government of Venezuela, how advancement for a service that would receive later). Neither credits to low rate, or subsidies of magnitude (the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, for example, gave one for projects of improvements at the end of 2005, of some $150.000 of the times, barely sufficient for some arrangements in infrastructure and in the security), in the least tolerance before the breaches: for workers everything was sacrifice and a extraordinary resolve.

Where did it come from, then, capital to set up and equip the rooms, put point the bar and the rooms and the rest of the arrangements mentioned? The answer is clear: of work. From the work of the members of the cooperative and of the solidarity of the other workers of recovered businesses and of community. From the solidarity of the thousands of people who collaborated with a few coins when the people of the BAUEN pedía on the street, students' that filled the alcancías that se they took a las faculties, of the peers of other recovered businesses who put the shoulder for feats on a small scale how the birthday of Rosalía Peñarrieta, of the support of a government in solidarity how the Bolivarian. But, fundamentally of work, from which sale capital in all geographies and in all the periods. No example clearer that the recovered businesses, in which workers build capital with which, little by little, and without resorting to any of the mechanisms expropriation with which se maximize housewares, the groundwork was laid to turn the wheel of production. In the BAUEN everything was effort, with a single objective: return to have regulate income through work of everyone of the members a the cooperative.

However, and in contrast with other recovered businesses in which the bosses, fact stripping, literally disappeared of the map, in this case the businesspeople never thought that the business of exploit a hotel without put money had ended. In reality, what they should have seen in this resurgence miraculous of the hotel was a new opportunity. By the middle of 2005, the Argentine economy was no longer that of the critical years that desembocaron in the crisis. The internal market and the industrial structural se were recovering, and the type of competitive change that had remained as a result of the loud fall of the convertibility and the devaluation resulting returned a make Buenos Aires a place hotel attractive.

*Clarín* lo constataba in a note signed by Osvaldo Pepe the 20 of June of 2005:

> The rise of the tourism is good news. It moves money, gives work.

But the mode of development and the projections of the activity enable too a turn of the screw more on social fragmentation.

Thus is it that we see a boom in investments in luxury hotels in the City. Businesspeople know what they're doing, at least in the search for profitability: occupancy of hotels of 4 and 5 stars grew a 27% in relation to 2004.[^48]

### Chicken or egg

The Iurcovich group already was to command of Hugo, the son of the founder Marcelo, but continued having the same tricks. For them, the hotel had never stopped being their property. In that sense, had the advantage of really knowing the arguments they had to demand its return. While the version prevailing was that the Iurcoviches only were how creditors of Solari and how proprietary of the brand Bauen, the issue seemed be of complex resolution since the business that had gone bankrupt wasn't that of the Iurcoviches, but that of Solari, which, in turn, wasn't owner of the building because hadn't been able to pay for it. Therefore, the cooperative was in a problem, consisting of that hadn't clarity on a who claim him, with whom dispute the possibility of use the hotel in legal form. In this scheme, begin to wield the argument of that property belonged to a company whose conformation was quite similar to las of the rest of the Iurcovich group, with a directory in which figured Hugo himself and was represented by old personeros of the business.

However, that which had gone bankrupt was Solari, and then the cooperative was occupying a hotel whose property wouldn't it be of their former employers.

Although for workers coming from the Bauen original, who had been under a boss and that pattern was Iurcovich, there was no doubt the group followed behind of the difficulties that soon started to appear. Instead, for the rest the panorama appeared legally confused. A article without signature or sources of the website of news Urgente24 mentioned a “research” of a ignota magazine Edition i,[^49] in which se tried locate every plot and the dispute between workers and the Iurcovich group how a simple and enough coarse political operation driven by Diego Kravetz (that would do it in the name of the “ibarrismo,” the partisan of the already former Chief of Government port city Aníbal Ibarra) to damage al new leader of the city, Jorge Telerman. In the crazy web that raises the magazine it is affirmed that Mercoteles bought the hotel al Iurcovich group once the bankruptcy judge returned to him property taking it away from Solari SA. From Mercoteles reads verbatim that “no there are many data on this enterprise, that declares have the funds to recondition the building and put it a function correctly.”

The issue of when and how was held this sale is key, because it is what protects the pretensions of the Iurcoviches and lets them appear over and over claiming the eviction of the BAUEN. The ownership title of the building of Callao 360, almost by magic, appeared of turn in their hands. Remember that when is produced bankruptcy and in the first years of the recovery of the hotel by the workers, these apparently didn't have anything to do or with bankruptcy or with the buyer business.

And who formed Mercoteles, than of soon appeared wielding the ticket of trading in his power? Supposedly, it was about a new company, without relationship with none of the previous. Iurcovich, according to the “research” above cited, recovered the ownwership of building stemming from the bankruptcy of Solari, that had not finished pay the sale. He sold it, in turn, to a third party, Mercoteles. Years later, in 2010, Mercoteles did a change of authorities and fijó a new home, without to work sale some or substantial changes in stockholder composition. It turns out that, by the Official Bulletin no. 31.973, dated of the 26 August of 2010, we found out that Hugo Eduardo Iurcovich, son of Marcelo Iurcovich, DNI 11.478.326, Argentine, divorced, with home real in the Av. From the Liberator 8008, story 24, department 2, Federal Capital, was director owner of Mercoteles from the 12 of January of 2006. And by Bulletin Official of the day prior that the business fixed their home, by Minutes of Directorate of the 01/06/2010, in Av. of the Liberator number 8008, story 24, of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. As can be appreciate, the personal home of Hugo Iurcovich and the home of Mercoteles are the same. It was no longer necessary being hidden.

In reality, the sale of the Bauen a Mercoteles was done with few days of difference with the formation of that signature. While the employees of the ravine Solari SA continued working on tower of Callao 360 and lived with anguish the obvious decadence of their job, fearing the bleak future of the unemployment that se les came above, as, in fact, soon was going to happen, between backstage was made going from property from a company that had sold a hotel four years earlier a a company that had just been formed and that, as said the article, no was known which was their heritage real.

As everything in the history of the business Bauen and the Iurcovich group, confusion is the norm. There's discrepancies and different versions of the dates, but not alter the bottom of the issue. We will take here the dates that slogan the judge herself of bankruptcy, Paula Hualde, in the judgment of first instance that orders the eviction of the cooperative for “return” property a Mercoteles SA. This chronology, does not coincides exactly with the information provided by other two sources, research of the journalist Guillermo Berasategui[^50] and the criminal complaint made by the then defend general attached of the City of Buenos Aires, Roberto Gallardo.[^51] However, on the very dates given by the judge it is clear that the sale is made of Iurcovich a Iurcovich at a time when didn't have the ownwership of property.

Chronicle of a sale announced

The 25 July of 2001 (or June, according to Berasategui and Gallardo), arguing that the sale to Solari was void because had not been ended of pay (what to say, then, about the hotel itself, with the debt al BANADE), Marcelo Iurcovich it sold the BAUEN a Mercoteles, enterprise that had been inscribed as such in the Inspection General of Justice not long ago, and with a social capital miniscule. That is, were sold the hotel a themselves.

However, the data no left until enough time later. Even the detailed research of Santiago O'Donnell, published in Página/12 in July, of 2007, attributes the manuever a year 2005. Recently some years later, the work of Guillermo Berasategui and the report of Gallardo they put in relief the Gordian knot from this story.

[^50]: Guillermo Berasategui, “To specter is haunting the Hotel Bauen,” portal Rebelión, 30 April 2012. Recovered from http://www.rebellion.org/news/2012/4/148778.pdf.

[^51]: 1.a Inst. Com. no. 9, Sec. n.° 18, “Solari SA s/ breaks (indirect),” 69.699 , 20 July of 2007, judgment.

Clarifying the issue with the data that the judge herself that denies the right to the cooperative a manage the hotel, Paula Hualde, makes record in the judgment on which for the first time orders their eviction for “restituirlo” a Mercoteles, we can reconstruct the following sequence: a	 Constitution of the business Mercoteles SA: The business Mercoteles SA signs up in the Inspection General of Justice (IGJ) the day 27 of June of 2001, according to the judge, although in the Official Bulletin n.º 29.678 published the 28 of June of 2001, figures as constituted the 20 June of the same year. b	 Venta of the hotel a Mercoteles: Bauen SACIC sells the property a Mercoteles SA the 25 July of 2001, according to establish in point III, i) of the judgment of the judge Hualde. Gallardo slogan that, in accordance with writing which is attached to the cause in fojas 6431/6453, the date of the sale is the 25 June, one month before, which would be still gravest. According to dates for Gallardo, Mercoteles buys the hotel five days after created. c	 Transfer of the ownership of Solari SA a Bauen SACIC: The judge commercial Eduardo Favier Dubois (h) restitute the property of Callao 360 that was in property of the failed business, Solari SA, a the prior owner, Bauen SACIC, the 29 August of 2001. The decision was confirmed by the Room C of the Chamber Commercial the 25 October of 2002. Favier Dubois was the owner of the Commercial Court no. 9, that then occupies Hualde. Note that the restitution isn't a Mercoteles but a Bauen. d	 Accreditation of the sale before the court: Mercoteles SA credit the ownwership of building of Callao 360 before the court of the Dra. Hualde (that had already replaced Favier Dubois) the 10 of December of 2004.

The reader will be able to warn a wide incongruity in the dates. Not only the latter, in which Mercoteles (which is to say, the front men of the Iurcoviches) presents before the court that “understands” in the bankruptcy of Solari SA three and a half years after have acquired property. There's something much more serious, that lo we're going to put in words that the judge herself Paula Hualde used in the judgment of first instance of the 20 July of 2007, in an observation to which finally would seem no give him importance:

It should be observed that such as was pointed out in the pto. III e), Bauen SACIC sold the property to Mercoteles SA the day 25 July of 2001, which is to say previously even that be available their restitution a who by then appeared as registered owner.[^52]

[^52]: 1.a Inst. Com. no. 9, Sec. n.° 18, “Solari SA s/ breaks (indirect),” 69.699 , 20 July of 2007, judgment, fs. 7

In relation to this, the report of Gallardo established the sale of the hotel a Mercoteles the 25 of June of 2001, hardly five days after constituted the business. says Gallardo in its complaint:

> (…) work in our power copy of report of domain corresponding al 8 of November of 2005, where establish the sale of the property in question dated 25 of June of 2001 (Attachment I), when according to resolution of V.S. mentioned in the previous point, is presented documentation recent the 22 of March of 2006 (five years later) in which figure settled the sale carried out the 25 July of 2001, of the that arises ownership of Mercoteles SA.[^53]

Furthermore, own Iurcovich tacitly admit the made in their own chronology that, without give exact dates but only the months, situates the sale of the hotel a the business Mercoteles SA in July, of 2001, and the restitution of the domain until that moment in power of Solari SA in August. The misrepresentation is that that devolution was “a their owner of domain, Mercoteles SA,”[^54] when really, the restitution was a Bauen SA, as established in the judgment of the judge herself

That is, Iurcovich sold it to Mercoteles, which is to say itself, a hotel that in the papers did not have, that le was reinstated recent one month or two later, in accordance with both dates in dance. And, later, only communicated it to the bankruptcy court almost four years later. It hid, therefore, the sale to knowledge of the court, with no consequence, since the judge took as valid the purchase. If we turn the viewpoint, and we suppose that Mercoteles really was a different company (thing that no appears to be thus when we observe composition and the progressive changes of their directory until arrive al today), too is noteworthy how this signature was encouraged a buy a property that the seller couldn't credit how of his, since recent one month then the judge returned to him the rights that were, yet, in power of Solari.

And, even more why the judge herself Hualde, having noted the mismatch of dates for the operations, decides ignore it ruling that the cooperative has to to evict the hotel and crediting property a Mercoteles?

Of course, none of this is a surprise for workers. Faced with they, Marcelo Iurcovich never stopped introducing himself as the boss, the true, as he did the same day of the occupation of the hotel in March of 2003.

All this take think of, with enough indications of their plausibility, that the manuever of stripping of the hotel Bauen included in principle the sale to Solari, and also the own breaks of Solari with the unpaid sale, which let Marcelo Iurcovich come back by being with property and sell it to yes same how Mercoteles, for which not even judged necessary wait for that the property was returned to him judicially, as, in fact, occurred. But this last sale had also the advantage of that se was taking out of above to the employees, that had stayed how creditors of the bankruptcy of a company (Solari SA) that wasn't none of the two of this operation (Bauen SA and Mercoteles SA). Also, as notes Gallardo, too got out from under the mortgage that weighed on property. says Gallardo:

In writing it was established that se sold how free from mortgage liens, writing that work added in this cause a fs. 6431/6453. Subsequently, can be seen in the seats of the Registry of Real Estate that we accompanied, that the 28 August of 2001 was recorded a seat that annuls the seat prior of expiration of mortgages, which is why such rates became operational again, but once made writing transferrence of domain in favor of Mercoteles.

That is, the mortgage that weighed on Bauen SACIC by the debt with the BANADE disappeared in the sale to Mercoteles, that ends up with a hotel without debts. The mortgage reappeared then how of the old enterprise Bauen, that no longer has any property. This was disputed judicially and the Room C of the Chamber Civil on the date 12 September of 2002 ruled that wasn't valid that operation, questioning also the attitude of Mercoteles. As cited the defend general attached Roberto Gallardo:

“It's not in good faith who, availing himself of information provided by the Registry, (expiration of the seats where consisted mortgages), acquired the functional units as if were free from mortgage liens.”

To be clearest: the key of the manuever is take the step from properties without debts, with the mortgage in the hands of a company that no longer has property, and without workers, expelled by the closure of the hotel bankrupt ilusoriamente by Solari.

A manuever characteristic of the astuteness of the bourgeoisie Argentine to make money of the nothing, technically perfect, if it wasn't for a detail. In Argentina of 2001, workers had learned to defend your jobs occupying businesses.

## The macrismo enters on stage: the “Morando Law”

While the judicial minuet was developed after bastidores, the workers of the BAUEN were confronted with a threatens for the moment more concrete.

After the massacre of Cromagnon (see box), product of corruption systematic and long-standing between the businesspeople and the State of the City of Buenos Aires, the issue highly sensitive of the security in the spectacles became the excuse to adjourn numerous recreational spaces and open to the public. In the case of the BAUEN, served to ask for the cessation of economic activities of the cooperative by lack of habilitación. The transcended was that the report arrived from the building of the turn, the BAUEN Suite. During the first months of 2005, fairly when the hotel began to be stabilized under the management of the cooperative, there were two attempts to closing. The inspectors of the Government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires reached hotel the 17 of March of 2005 and were expelled by the workers. The same happened the 8 of April.

Again, the 5 of June of 2005, yet under the mandate of Aníbal Ibarra how Head of Government, already very beaten by the consequences of Cromagnon (what would cost it the position some months then), the workers of the BAUEN would face a more serious attempt of closing administrative by the GCBA. The episode was filmed as a whole by the camera attentive of Fabián Pierucci, of the Alavío Group, who included the scene whole in its documentary. “The State knows, justice knows that the recovered businesses lack a habilitación official, but we in spite of that we went enhancing everything that is security, by the area that we have… we went very responsible,” said a the microphones Marcelo Ruarte, then president of the cooperative, the day of the operating.

From there in the future was opened other battleline. The government of Buenos Aires, that never had found nothing outside of rule that merited a closing during the administration of the Iurcoviches (or about Solari), now seemed be shown very jealous of the safety conditions of the hotel. It was the first time since was established worker management that functionaries of the Government of the City coincided with the Iurcoviches in harass the cooperative. Curious and contradictorily, shortly after a direction especially created by the government to give subsidies a recovered businesses gave them a financing to improve parameters of security.

To couple of years later, under the leadership of Mauricio Macri, would disappear those contradictions. The whole GCBA would be hostile to the cooperative.

Ruarte, in those days, summed up the situation in these terms:

>We what we have through the judge that understands in bankruptcy is custody of the property. Later, we're in contact with the Government of the City, we're advancing in an expropriation, working on an enormous debt who has of ABL this gentleman what do you say which is the owner. So due to that we want see: how much is the debt, how much is worth the hotel. And due to that, if politicians agree and want to give us a hand, that the State take charge of the hotel and the cooperative pay it off. […] And we're talking about a hotel, that was done here, with funds of the State (national), that too there there is a sort of nebula, that never were returned.

The closing in fact was done, as is seen in the film. Also is seen there how the workers of the BAUEN ignored that closing, and simply covered with posters and cadres the sashes, hoping that be resolved meanwhile the issue, but while still work because of a complaint with clear smell a have left of the usinas of Iurcovich.

Shortly before, the 11 of February of the 2005, the Court where processed the bankruptcy of Solari had authorized the cooperative to take charge of the guard judicial of the property. It is true that workers not only sought guard the assets of the hotel but maintain it working and preserve (and even increase) jobs. Although wasn't what sought, that resolution, at least, gave them true legal umbrella, something that does not abound in history of the BAUEN recovered.

As was to be expected, the 17 of March a presentation of Mercoteles was opposed al comodato that favored the cooperative, precisely stemming from that workers were using the hotel to work (why if not?). A short time later did so Bauen SACIC, alleging that workers were exploiting commercially the brand Bauen. Even did so the failed Solari, showing a solid solidarity employer in spite of your interests, in appearance, opposing. So solid that one might thinf that those interests were, really, the same.

### The Struggle moves to the Legislature

The expropriation bill that mentioned Marcelo Ruarte was presented before the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires by Diego Kravetz, legislator and at the same time the cooperative's lawyer, although since its access to the Parliament of Buenos Aires the representation of the cooperative the was taking forward, their sister Florencia.

The tool of expropriation laws had already been used widely to be able to legally consolidate the recovery processes of businesses and factories of widely varying kinds by their workers. The first cases were given in the province of Buenos Aires and, through 2002, in the City. These first examples were the cooperative Chilavert and the cooperative Vieytes, a factory of supplies for ice-cream shops, in October of that year. It didn't take long for arrive others, until a number of thirteen that were finally grouped in the Law 1529/2004, presented fairly by Kravetz, that already made a year that was Deputy. There was entered how legislator by a list headed (for national deputies) by Miguel Bonasso, and soon had added to the bloc of the Front for Victory, of hand of the then Chief of Cabinet, Alberto Fernández. The relationships of Kravetz with the MNER, that had been their trampoline to the diputación, but of which was looking for detach now, started to become tense. In spite of that, reached an agreement on the presentation of that bill, called of “definitive expropriation,” to differentiate it from the previous laws which were of temporary occupancy for a term of two years.

The bill consisted of grouping all the recovered businesses that were protected by these temporary laws (a the oldest, how Chilavert, was ending the term) in a law collective. That also implied a negotiation with the other fraction on which had divided the movement, led by the lawyer Luis Caro, whose bill encompasses only a five cooperatives which were members of their organization. The “law Kravetz,” how the very legislator pugnaba by call, included finally al set. The Law 1529 anticipated that the payment of the severance (mandatory by precept Constitutional for all the expropriations) was made by the GCBA, but then returned by the benefitted cooperative, having two years grace and then another 20 to pay the amount in installments, at the end of which would happen to be owner of the goods. After more than a decade, the law almost was not applied, and are counted the expropriations that were paid. But the cooperatives were able to some type of coverage legal. Others cases left adding a the law later, and the extension that in two occasions it was voted that in the camera was vetoed by Macri how Chief of Government, inaugurated a custom which would culminate in the Presidential veto of the 26 of December of 2016.

But the BAUEN was not between those thirteen or between the later. Federico Tonarelli, explains that “how the bills of expropriation that were approved for Chilavert, Grissinópoli, Ghelco or the Printing Patricians, that of the BAUEN, presented by Diego Kravetz, was too of temporary occupancy for two years.” The bill, with the number 1505, entered the 16 of June of 2005 and was signed too by the legislators Ana Suppa, Mónica Bianchi, Silvia The Ruffa, Fernando Cantero, Fernando Melillo, Sergio Molina, Daniel Betti, Milcíades Peña and Arturo Floreal, who represented different blocks. The panorama was no longer as favorable as not long ago, because from the elections of 2003 (and those of 2005 ratified it) the bloc more nourished was the on the right macrista.

This first bill declared of public utility and subject to expropriation for two years both the property and your facilities, furniture e intangible, including in this last concept the brands and patents. Also, granted it immediately the temporary occupancy of the hotel a the cooperative “formed by the former workers of Solari SA” as long as maintained economic use of the property. The payment of the severance was extracted (“compensated”) of the total debts that had the business Solari with the GCBA.

“As the volume of the BAUEN as a business was much bigger than in the prior cases, in the macrismo, seeing that Kravetz pushed temporary expropriation, started to work an alternative bill,” explains Tonarelli. “As there was no an alternative bill –could not be presented a bill so it would not be expropriated–, Morando took out of the galley that bill known as “Morando Law.”

Mario Morando was one of the deputies of the PRO, yet a party existing only in the City of Buenos Aires and that had almost won the elections for Chief of Government in 2003, when Mauricio Macri lost the second round against Aníbal Ibarra. But that election installed him as a first political strength in the district, and that would be strengthened in the following years until the triumph in the Buenos Aires elections in 2007.

By that time, the confrontation between workers of the cooperative and the Iurcoviches and its allies was reaching levels that had not yet been seen. The political climate of the city was changing, not only for the fall of Ibarra after Cromagnon, but by the progressive growth of the PRO and the simultaneous fall of the reigning progressivism and of the parties and options on the left, that in the legislature prior (the one elected in the year 2001) had reached to have an important although fragmented interblock of seventeen deputies. Approve expropriation laws after the change in the composition of forces in the Legislature turned out more and more difficult.

The fight was not limited to the Parliament or a judicial benches. In contrast to others employers of recovered businesses, the Iurcoviches, now characterized as Mercoteles, were given an active communication policy. the Internet portals and some important half took out every so often articles that were no more than propaganda covered in favor of the turn of the bosses and attacks to the workers. The 28 of June of 2005, Mercoteles until was encouraged a an publisher in the newspaper *La Nación* directed to the Legislature, entitled “Hotel Bauen: a the legislators of the city and a public opinion in general.” The arguments were the usual and that then were used to found the “Morando Law.” It ended affirming: Señores legislators: doesn't exist public utility in this bill, that tries to legalize an illegal occupation and that affect: the right to property legitimately acquired; the rights of the taxpayers affected by the disposition of public funds; workers' rights to social security; the right to the creditors of bankruptcy; and the right to safety of the life of the occupants and guests of the hotel.”

However, the most suggestive weren't the arguments, widely well-known, but, in the light of later events, the signers of the publisher. It was about the agents of both signatures. The agent of Bauen SACIC was Gerardo Mario Palomero, DNI 13.404.076, a who later we will find making declarations in the newspaper *Clarín* how…agent of Mercoteles.[^55] The agent of Mercoteles, for its part, was Susana Beatriz Espósito, DNI 10.121.348. Currently, Espósito is common of the PRO elected in in 2011 and, according to their CV, is lawyer, scribe and licenciada in Safety. In reality, according to the Official Bulletin n.º 31.544 of the 2 of December of 2008, the lady Espósito is owner of a company that, among other things, is dedicated to the “marketing, distribution, import and export of raw materials and products written referred a the industry and accessories destined to security forces.” It's also the wife of Ricardo Pedace, a police that later will be one of the subcommanders of the Buenos Aires Police created by Macri, the Metropolitan and, under their successor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, boss of the Agency Governmental of Control.[^56]

[^55]: See declarations of Palomero in “It grows the conflict in the BAUEN and the owners ask for the eviction,” daily *Clarín*, 16 of June of 2014. Recovered from http://www.clarin.com/cities/It grows-conflict-Bauen-duenos-desalojo01157884261.html

We will again encounter her in this story, much later, with a closeness inconvenient a the judge that sent to evict the BAUEN favoring the signature represented by Espósito, Paula Hualde. Of course, will not be the lady Espósito the only connection between Mercoteles and the PRO.

In another requested published shortly after, the 7 July, it was argued that “the hotel has become a booty of war of greedy businesspeople, union opportunists and adventurers reckless; and now runs the risk of become also in victim of the authoritarianism demagogic.” Also appears there the name of Espósito.

### Agitated session in the Legislature

The climate of confrontation continued growing until, the 6 of December of 2005 the bills arrived to be dealt with in the recinto.

The bill of Kravetz no could enough vote to be approved, and above all, to defeat the bill of Morando. This bill was presented counterposed to that expropriated the hotel for workers, seeking a facade “voting” for various legislators with certain scruples.

Explica Federico Tornarelli:

> The bill posed that called the two parts in conflict, where appeared the first error of Iurcovich, because the two parts in conflict were the cooperative and that which result owner of domain of the building, because Justice not yet there was determined that was of Mercoteles. However, Morando puts that calls the two parts in conflict, Mercoteles and the cooperative.

[^56]: Ricardo Ragendorfer, “Marche a Bauen for the PRO,” portal Our Voces, 12 of March of 2017. Recovered from http://www.nuestrasvoces.com.ar/research/bauen-for-the-pro/

To evaluate what had been raised by the parts, was created a commission of seven legislators distributed proportionally between the blocks. “I mean that the commission was going to have majority of the macrismo,” adds Federico. This commission was going to call the two parts to negotiate an agreement.

But that agreement was unacceptable for the cooperative. Among your points was delivery of the building a Mercoteles. “There was three or four points that were not negotiated,” says Federico, “the first delivery of the property.” The majority macrista led to the recinto this bill to be treaty, while the expropriation I did not get the number necessary to be imposed.

The 6 of December, then, both bills were in conflict but that of Morando was that which carried las to win. A large rally accompanied the members of the cooperative until the door of the court. Seeing the circumstances, workers together with the MNER do an assembly to define the strategy.

In this assembly (which is registered, once more, in the documentary of Pierucci), happens a debate enough rough between workers, the leaders of the MNER (including Murúa and Resino) and Diego Kravetz. Kravetz tries to argue that the bill of temporary occupancy was going to lose and that the bill of Morando, that was going to win voting (finally did so by 29 votes, a number relatively low but sufficient), was going to be vetoed. says Kravetz in the assembly:

It was all going to come to nothing, with the difference that us we went to go with a defeat, for me…And this is an evaluation personal, there can be another evaluation, which is a defeat of our law properly, more a victory for me very clear of a sector policy that is the macrismo.”

gave then a rough and tense debate, in which the Deputy Kravetz started to propose that had that accept the bill of Morando because “this law, the only thing that makes for me is win time. You amagas that you sit, you leave, you rise up, you fight, nothing more! and gives you certain coverage.”

In summary, Kravetz proposed that, given that the expropriation did not have the votes to be approved, had to take the “Morando Law” as a way of win time before create another alternative, surely in other areas. “The solution for self-management is going to have to come necessarily from other side,” held. This wasn't accepted by the workers. Fabio Resino proposed then vote between accept the bill of Morando or lower to the enclosure try pressure a the legislators so that vote the expropriation. For Fabio, the only advantage were the 120 days in term, but it was about a law that “points to liquidate self-management and that must have it clear.”

Unhappy with the situation and the disappointing acting of whom was their first lawyer, workers decided enter al recinto where the legislators sought decide on his destination. There were struggles, shouts, chants in the tribunes and, finally, repression, although the session failed continue. But like it was about issue of patience, some days then the law could be approved.

In spite of their sanction, the so-called “Morando Law” never finished of be applied. Obviously, was unknown by the workers and the commission normalizing considered in the article first –having 120 days for the drafting of an agreement that considers the rights of property invoked by the former owners and the right to work of the members of the cooperative– never was constituted. However, persists as a milestone in the struggle for the recovery of the BAUEN not only for violence with which the police attacked to the workers in the session but for having been the beginning of the active collaboration of the macrismo with the Iurcoviches.

CROMAÑÓN, Or OF THE COMPLICITY

DEL STATE And THE ENTREPRENEURS

The 31 of December of the year 2004 a fire in a location known as Republic of Cromagnon, managed by Omar Emir Chabán, a figure of trajectory recognized in the rock Argentine since its role business, claimed the lives of 194 people, in its large majority youth. The survivors they stayed with serious aftermath physical and psychological, and even was who committed suicide a few months later (counting Martín Cisneros, who took his own life the 3 of February of 2015, were 17 survivors that committed suicide). There was no in the City of Buenos Aires a “tragedy” of such magnitude. More than tragedy, was a massacre: the roof of the establishment was covered for a material highly flammable and toxic where was a stop a Bengal and unleashed the fire, and the emergency exits were closed to prevent between people free to the recital of the bands of rock Callejeros. The cause put of manifesto the bribes that systematically were paying the owners of these ventures a the inspectors of the Government of the City, with the purpose of avoid inspections and pass over the adjustment of the local a the rules of security. Following this “discovery” –that was really a secret a voices– wine a seguidilla of closures in bars, restaurants and local danceable that had repercussions on the cultural environment and left artists practically without places available for to present itself in public. This gave way al birth of United Musicians by the Rock (MUR), whose first formal assembly, to which they attended more than 70 people, was celebrated the 11 of May of 2005 in the BAUEN hotel, although already se coming gathering there –and would continue doing it– every Wednesday. But also were family members and friends of victims of Cromagnon and survivors who always had the solidarity of the hotel workers, who made available to them the facilities in more than one occasion: in September of the 2007 was held there one of the chats of the cycle Think Cromagnon and, more recently, the 30 of December of the 2014, a ten years of massacre, the organization That No Se Repita gave there their press conference.

Respect to safety of youth that come out to be entertained in the Buenos Aires night, little and nothing seems to have changed: the 10 September of 2010 collapsed a mezzanine in the locale danceable Beara, fact left a balance of two dead and dozens of wounded.

The cause made evident the complicity of two functionaries from the government of Macri –Martín Farrell and Pablo Saikauskas– in the habilitación of the local.

## Eviction order

The “Morando Law” no got impose your conditions and the commission that anticipated meet never was constituted. The cooperative requested al then Chief of Government Jorge Telerman to veto the norm, but the functionary limited himself to no reglamentarla and present a bill that modified it, that was also never approved. In practice, this situation meant the abandonment of the Legislature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires how the place where was attempted to settle the conflict, that was transferred to the judicial sphere and to the Congress of the Nation. In these two environments would play out, in the form parallel and crusade, the future of the BAUEN in the following years.

The newspaper *Clarín*, in its derives more and more accentuated towards the “journalism of war” which, today exerts fully, already by then reflected in its coverage of the topic BAUEN the posture of Mercoteles.[^57] In an article of the 9 of January of 2006, dedicated to “time of definitions” that supposedly arrived for the hotel, practiced show “the two bells” and gave him voice a the Iurcoviches, putting in parallel the posture of the workers with that of the phantom enterprise. The article began affirming that, by the maturity of the term, Telerman should have promulgate the law or veto it, in a sort of pressure to force a definition. Remember that was a moment when the Chief of Government, recently assumed by the destitution of Aníbal Ibarra, made a complicated political balance between the majority macrista of the Legislature, the national government of Néstor Kirchner and their own political ambitions of continue in the position once finalized their interinato. Reluctant to play, left everything in limbo. In the same note, the agent of Mercoteles, Gerardo Palomero,[^58] declared that “the law drives a fair agreement and recognizes that the hotel has a owner,” to continue affirming that “Justice (…) ordered the restitution of the hotel a Mercoteles, but asked for the devolution of the four million pesos. It is a minor topic. The important thing is that Justice recognizes that belongs to Mercoteles.” The controversy was already installed, and lo that even that then was a conflict that transcurría in environments judicial and legislative started to be confronted too in public opinion and the half agenda. In the street, of course, was from the 21 of March of 2003.

Workers then decided try get the expropriation in the National Congress, given that the paths se had closed in the Legislature port. Until then, none recovered enterprise had happened the process of their expropriation there, but by provincial parliaments. It started a much longer path of what workers surely imagined when decided try it.

The first bill was presented the 20 July of 2006 before Congress of the Nation on the part of a group of legislators led by Francisco “Barba” Gutiérrez, historical leader of the Unity Worker Metallurgy of the sectional Quilmes, union that may be considered how the first promoter of factory recovery, at the end of the 8059. Gutiérrez was accompanied by a group mostly made up of deputies kirchneristas and some belonging to blocks more pequeños.[^60] In contrast to Kravetz's bill, that al be presented before the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires was supported in the debts that the former owners had with the GCBA for taxes, in this one se interpelaba for the first time al Nation-state to remind it that “the Hotel Bauen was created in 1978 during the dictatorship genocidal, with a credit mortgage of the extinct National Bank of Development (BANADE) that the family Iurcovich didn't pay,” concluding that “therefore, the BAUEN is (…) property of the State.” This argument would be repeated in the bills following, that to the extent that the previous were not dealt with and they lost parliamentary status, were presented by different deputies, over and over. It is, as we have already said, the central argument to consider expropriable a a hotel how the BAUEN. In spite of all this, it is not much different from the bill port city, on which too are expropriated the property, the facilities, furniture and the intangible (how brands and patents) in favor of the workers. In addition to the origin of the debts caused by the former owners, which would serve to compensate them for the expropriation, (and that in one case refer to the ABL and other taxes while in the other case is about of the loan of the BANADE from which was built the hotel), a substantial change is the referred to the authorities of application. The Secretariat of Production, Tourism and Sustainable Development of the GCBA in one case, and the Ministry of Works and Public Utilities of the Nation, in the other.

[^58]: Remember that, in the publisher of the 28 of June of 2005 in the newspaper *La Nación*, Palomero signed as agent of Bauen SACIC.

[^59]: Francisco “Barba” Gutiérrez had been elected as Deputy by the Polo Social, a short-lived force headed by the Father Farinello. Historical leader of the UOM Quilmes, that began his union activism in the '70s and was persecuted by the dictatorship, opposite of the then conduction national of the UOM, was one of the drivers of the business recovery by the workers in the southern zone of the Buenos Aires suburbs. Later was mayor of Quilmes by the Front for Victory, charge left with the triumph of the macrista Martiniano Molina in October of 2015.

[^60]: The bill of Francisco “Barba” Gutiérrez carried too the signature of the legislators and Kirchner legislators Susana Canela, Laura Sesma, Jorge Coscia, Juliana I gave Tullio, Araceli Méndez of Ferreyra, Edgardo From Petri, Diana Conti and Mercedes It marked From the Pont, as well as also that of Eduardo Macaluse and Santiago Ferrigno.

### You know what is a front man?

Also, between the considerings of the bill national already se complaint the relationship between the Iurcoviches and Mercoteles, which had been made evident in a trial unusual before a complaint of Mercoteles by the rape of fajas of closing before the Contravention Court no. 3. The prosecutor himself, Adrián Martín, declared that:

(…) this trial should have found solutions in other instances judicial –as the that leads bankruptcy– or policies. If this had occurred this process no se would have carried out. (...) While what is debated here is important, turns out to be absurd before to the problem background. By discuss something so specific we run the risk of leave aside central matter how factory recovery by their workers; or various groups economic that carry out maneuvers harto suspicious. us are happening elephants ahead and we cannot solve because we don't have competencia.[^61]

[^61]: “Two of lime one of sand: Bauen, the fight for expropriation,” portal ANRed, 28 of May of 2006. Recovered from http://www.anred.org/spip.PHP?article1512

The accused in this trial was who at the time was president of the cooperative, Marcelo Ruarte, dismissed by the judge Carla Cavaliere for a lack of animosity, in a ruling that too raised the closing and authorized the use of the property by the workers. But the most juicy was not both in the favorable resolution but rather in the paper that made the witnesses and representatives of Mercoteles, that didn't get something else more than make it clear that it was about a phantom company controlled by the Iurcoviches. The cited article of the agency ANRed lo clearly shows:

For its part, the statement of Gustavo Ruggero, maintenance worker of the Bauen Suite, did not know give has correctness who they are your bosses. aimed that currently works for the business Ghesa SA but that their relationship everyday is with Luciana and Mónica Iurcovich, daughters of the fallecido Marcelo Iurcovich, ancient owner of the Bauen. The young person also admitted to knowing Samuel Kaliman. This way, appeared more indications on the direct relationship between Mercoteles SA and the BAUEN Suite, according to complaint of the workers. It is that Mercoteles is made up of frontmen and family direct of the Iurcovich.[^62]

Diego Carbone, the lawyer that started to represent the cooperative instead of Florencia Kravetz, declared that: The testimony to Samuel Kaliman, that was presented as General Director of Mercoteles, was shameful. said that did not know the legal headquarters of the company, stockholder composition, when met the directorate. Why want annoy us? Because this group of workers put light where they wanted put sombra.[^63]

The scene of the very poor acting of Kaliman, brother-in-law of Marcelo Iurcovich, is registered in the documentary of Pierucci and does not have waste. In a small office of the court, the representative of Mercoteles did not hit to respond correctly simple questions, how the address of functioning of the business. Kaliman seemed not understand the consultation about the relationship between Mercoteles SA and the BAUEN, looking at the functionaries judicial as a schoolboy that didn't do his homework and repeating the question rather than respond. After affirming that “Mercoteles is the society that administers the hotel” and that Carbone object that affirmation (“the hotel is administered by a cooperative”), had to recognize that did not administer “directly the hotel,” but that this one “belonged to the company Mercoteles.” Also he had a hard time saying where was working Mercoteles, until finally had to recognize that was in the BAUEN Suite, which is to say, tower border that never stopped belong to Iurcovich group. Nor could respond when had been the last meeting of the directorate, or which topics had been dealt with. The cherry on top was when Diego Carbone, between exasperated and embarrassed by attitude and the abulia of Kaliman, asked him straight out if knew the definition of the word front man. With a resigned face, of someone who is requesting please that take it out of a suplicio, Samuel Kaliman could this time give a response: “is a person that acts covering the presence of another.” That, clear, was more real that the address of Mercoteles.

### A new actor enters on stage: the judge Hualde

The triumph in this trial could not be very celebrated by the workers, because almost without give respite was presented in the hotel the 16 of May of 2006, to make a “visual inpection,” the bankruptcy judge of the Bauen, Paula Hualde, that had replaced Favier Dubois. According to said to the workers, was doing the inspection by a writing of Mercoteles that thus lo solicitaba.[^64] This way, the judge Hualde appeared on the scene of the conflict and would not leave it again.

While the expropriation bill wrecked in Congress, Hualde advanced in issue their judgment in which, in spite of having proved some of the irregularities pointed out by the lawyers of the cooperative, would order the first eviction of the hotel to return it to Mercoteles.

In a trade which gives so many circles that, despite technical language of rigor, ends up being confused, Hualde attributed it the ownwership of building a Mercoteles and, accordingly, ordered their abandonment by the workers. He incurred in contradictions: the most notorious which we already pointed out, on which, in spite of check the fact that the business Bauen SA sold the property to a recently created firm and with capital of only $100.000 (10.000 shares of $10 each one) in a date in which did not have in his power the ownwership of hotel, just the same, decided that was Mercoteles the owner. Also decided not to give importance to the fact that that sale was “denounced” recent the 10 of December of 2004 by the creditor prendario Marcelo Hilario Gardella, other old acquaintance of the business network of the Iurcovich group and Mercoteles. On the contrary, opted to to conclude that none of that prevented the business that was not in power of the hotel, neither on paper nor in facts (in spite of the presence in the shadows of Marcelo Iurcovich that signaled workers), carry out the sale.

[^64]: Ib.

After to review some facts relative to the history of the hotel through bankruptcy (without even mention the prior circumstances) and of support themselves in the passage of the Law 1914 (the “Morando Law”), Hualde passed explain that in their “visual inpection” of the 17 of May of 2006 could see that:

(…) the poor state of conservation of some sectors of the building could result in risk to health and the life of the members of the cooperative and other employees, of the hotel guests and of other citizens that could be found circumstantially in the place in reason of exploitation that of the same is carried out as a restaurant, festival hall, conferences, theater and bar.[^65]

Although never registry the court a “visual inpection,” for example, for the first few months of 2003, or even in the last of 2001, with which power compare the State of the hotel and the advances achieved by worker management, Hualde se supported in the case of Cromagnon to argue the lack of security as a motive for the eviction. She would be worrying, then, by health of the members of the cooperative, although not by other circumstances more everyday and that encompass health how a dignified income to live guaranteed by work, just what were achieving workers. slipped too, al pass, the suspicion of the labor fraud, al say “the members of the cooperative and other employees.” It is known that, in Argentine legislation, worker co-ops can't have employees but associated that work (because that is the object of this cooperative form), which is why the hiring of employed by outside of the cooperative constitutes a fraud laboral66, that obviously wasn't the case of the BAUEN, where always associated with all the workers. The judge pointed out have sent the result of that inspection a a multitude of public bodies that should have occupied of the topic, without result.

[^65]: 1.a Inst. Com. no. 9, Sec. n.° 18, “Solari S.To. s/ breaks (indirect),” 69.699, 20 July of 2007, judgment.

[^66]: The labor fraud in worker cooperatives is used for outsourcing and labor precariousness, even by big businesses, forcing to the workers to figure how members of a false cooperative instead of hire them in relationship of dependence. This frees the employer of the payment social expenses, and takes away from the worker labor rights, pension payments according to the work carried out in fact, seniority and affiliation union. To fire them, they are forced to leave the cooperative or directly is cut the contractual relationship between the cooperative and the business, avoiding the cost of pay severance to the worker. Of course, this is not the case in the recovered businesses, in spite of which have proliferated trials on which former members try demonstrate have been employed by the cooperative. In general, those cases are dismissed for the recovered businesses.

Next, concluded rapidly that there was no option but to “return” the building of Callao 360 al registered owner, which is to say, Mercoteles, but than as judge considered contemplate the “consequences disvaliosas” of this restitution, that shrewdly deduced which were the loss of work of cooperators. He cites then some cases, obtained of the web of the The National Movement of Factories Recovered by the Workers Recovered (MNFRT), and that these were given:

“almost always under the same pattern of ‘…bankrupt businesses and employees with years of experience who actively resisted the role of unemployed…’ (see Farina, “Worker cooperatives and the new text of the article 190 of the bankruptcy law. Need for adequate legal regulation” in Doctrine Societaria and bankruptcy, Errepar, nº 180, p.730 and ss).”

I don't know took much work, obviously, in to investigate what is a recovered business, at a time when already could find abundant academic literature with conclusions a little more complex and founded that said, or in find out that the BAUEN cooperative was not part of the The National Movement of Factories Recovered by the Workers Recovered. This movement responds al lawyer Luis Caro and has a focus on the topic that, while in some basic points are shared by all the organizations, in other, related especially with the legal question and on what consider a recovered business (although he uses exclusively “factory,” as a way of be differentiated from the MNER), are substantially different and can't be extrapolated to all the organizations. Workers of the BAUEN were enrolled in the National Movement of Recovered Businesses (MNER) from the beginning, and already for the moment of the judgment of Hualde had founded the FACTA, which is why would have been correct, at least, search the definitions and foundations of these organizations.

This isn't a detail because is part of the arguments of the judge to reject the right of the workers on the hotel. She deduced from this express research on recovered businesses that the end of these isn't “the only labor continuity, but tends to provide an alternative of negotiation between workers united in cooperatives and the creditors of the bankrupt to be able, through the assumption of the passive falencial, acquire the failed business.” continued arguing what was already affirmed thousand The judge did, in this part of the judgment, a double interpretation. She took as valid and satisfactory the “offer” of the “Morando Law” that proposed that Mercoteles use to the workers of the cooperative, among others theoretical concessions (how the recognition of the costs of repair of the building made by the cooperative, until a sum obviously insufficient of $150.000). In that line, did record that Mercoteles S.To. carried out a formal offering “…for support the solution of the conflict created as a result of the bankruptcy of the signature Solari S.To. with the former-workers of the same and others personal currently incorporated and nucleated under the orders of the Cooperative Buenos Aires A National Business Limited…” highlighting their “…entreprenuerial will to structure a positive way out to the same based on the proposals that se assume as obligations….”

In other words, Mercoteles reaffirmed that was prepared to renew the proposal made already in the “Morando Law” (recognizing indirectly, in passing, their authorship or at least participation in the own formulation of the law). But, a that, the judge added to it that accept and make this kind of negotiations is one of the objectives of the recovered businesses, in accordance with the particular conception that took to define this complex social and economic process.

Synthesizing and simplifying: the bosses offers a negotiation and the recovered businesses are made to negotiate with the employers. Only was missing that vacate the hotel. That is, logically, what follows as conclusion of the judgment: “Corresponde then, a light of the above and with scope which arises form the present, dispose the restitution of the property sito in Av. Callao 346/60 where works the Hotel Bauen, a their owner of domain.” Of course, reached this point, there is a problem: the hotel is in full operation under the management of the BAUEN cooperative. From no accept supply, the judge had to order the eviction, and, as was made clear in every the arguments that we have cleared until here, in his eyes heavenly the blame of the eviction is, with no more, of the workers themselves, inflexible to accept an offer they couldn't refuse.

So as to not abuse, and by the inconveniences that could cause a the hotel guests, the resolution fixed a term of 30 days for “be able to put into effect with the oldest prolijidad and tranquility possible the restitution of the property,” which would be given a publicity by edicts that, was missing more, had to pay Mercoteles SA.

That term was up the 20 August of the year 2007. As we know almost ten years later, things did not turn out the way wanted the judge Paula Hualde or Mercoteles SA, that lost money of the notices in the newspapers *La Nación* and *Clarín*. Among other things, the whole judgment was based on a false supposition: the workers of the BAUEN did not make a cooperative or occupied the hotel to negotiate with Iurcovich. As in all the recovered businesses of the country, did so to be able to work worthily.

## Resistance and self-management

The eviction ordered by the judge Paula Hualde unleashed a wave of solidarity with the workers of the BAUEN that continued growing endlessly from then. If there's a characteristic which had the recovery of the centric hotel was its breadth and solidarity, receiving all kinds of manifestation of popular struggle in their rooms and providing hospitality, which led to that that open-door policy come back, but toward them, in the difficult times that followed.

The news of the eviction order fell like a bomb that, instead of destroy, built a barrier of solidarity that crossed very diverse political and social sectors, even at the international level. The BAUEN of the workers already had constituted in a global point of reference of self-management. Immediately, was organized a press conference that overflowed the room of the bar Utopia, in which were unions, political parties, recovered businesses, bodies of human rights, university students, intellectual.

It was not just about political relationships, was the feeling of the hotel workers, especially those who had worked for the Iurcoviches, how Arminda, that declared that (had worked) “with that enterprise for twenty years and I know very well those people. Because at this moment we are not we have nothing to negotiate with them, because BAUEN is our, is going to be our, even if they don't like it.” And the answer was a large mobilization, up close of 5.000 people, that logically exceeded widely a the members of the BAUEN cooperative, that was directed loudly al Commercial Court no. 9, a few blocks from the hotel. A visit that would be repeated several times over the years.

The day that time is up for leave the building, the 21 August of 2007, was organized a massive recital in the doorway, on Callao avenue, on which they played various groups musical, were received hundreds of adherences and closed León Gieco. There, was improvised an assembly that was extended the whole length of the avenue, in which Fabio Resino asked the crowd if were ready to sustain al BAUEN:

> Companions: Workers of the BAUEN, like so many workers, where se lets us, we decided in assembly. So we're going to transform this act in a large assembly and les we want move to you if are ready to resist together to the workers until the end. We raise the hands if we're agreed peers! Long live the struggle of the BAUEN! Long live the businesses managed by their workers!

Of course, the answer was an acclamation. The eviction order it was not made effective, and the cooperative appealed the measure. That let a certain tranquility to the workers, while was still the dispute in the judicial sphere.

### The formation of FACTA

While were given these disputes in the judicial sphere and legislative, the old organization mother of the recovered businesses, the National Movement of Recovered Businesses, entered in a crisis. The political differences and of organizational practices had come to a point of no return that brought on a new division of the MNER. To significant part of the movement opted to create a federation of cooperatives instead of the lax structure and excessively dependent on leaders that was coming giving until then. The Argentine Federation of Cooperatives of Self-Managed Workers (FACTA) was managed then how a structure federated that gathered recovered businesses and other self-managed worker cooperatives, that over time became diversified and ever more distant from the imprint of the MNER original. The BAUEN always had a central place into the Federation, and Fabio Resino, first, and Federico Tonarelli, then and until today, occupied leadership roles. Since then, the FACTA is indissolubly linked to the history of the BAUEN.

The Federation he settled the 9 of December of 2006. Fabio Resino, in the official presentation of the Federation (that was carried out months later in the hotel), summarized it thus:

> FACTA emerges as a necessary tool, of unity, of the cooperatives and of the recovered businesses. Not only as a tool to fight for, that yes, is very necessary be united in the struggle for the expropriations, by businesses that yet missing, by a national law of expropriation, by a trust fund, to be able to be subject of credit of the banking entities, all that struggle which is legitimate and positive. And too as a tool of unity to be able compete in a capitalist market where the cooperatives individually are condemned to failure. So if we are setting up productive networks and of capitalization we have many more chances to survive in that market so difficult for a worker cooperative, that don't have capitalization or have state support and that of course everything is much more complicated.67 But in contrast to MNER, constituted exclusively by recovered businesses, the Federation intended from its beginning expand the connection with other collectives of self-managed workers. 

Resino continues:

> We are worker cooperatives which are self-managed businesses, because are recovered businesses some and other are cooperatives, that while they are not recovered businesses in the broad sense of the word yes are cooperatives that have allowed recover work and the dignity of the peers that make them up and that apart self-manage their destiny, so, that's why we'sees named it Argentine Federation of Cooperatives of Self-Managed Workers. can be here any kind of cooperative, can be worker cooperative, service cooperative, housing cooperative. The condition that we put is that they are self-managed and that exists that horizontal relationship within the cooperative.

[^67]: http://www.revolutionvideo.org/agoratv/programs/empresasrecuperadas/factapresentacion.html

The role of the BAUEN was important for the social fabric and political that conformó the Federation. Resino also highlights:

> (...) which means the BAUEN, their relationship and their geographic location, that comes to be a nucleus of relationship with another kind of workers, for example the Casino68. Everything the conflict of the workers of the Casino lo have developed in assemblies that were made in the BAUEN, the same thing the people of the Mail, those of the Subway, and so many conflicts they happen, are developed and decisions are made on the inside of the BAUEN, and all those matters we believe that is necessary take them to the breast of the Federation.

With this, FACTA se pronounced clearly by belonging to the working class and in that sense, “that each struggle, of each worker, is also their struggle, and that doesn't matter if the fellow is an employee or is part of a cooperative.”

As the years went by FACTA became consolidated as an organization with national reach, with affiliated cooperatives in different jurisdictions, how the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, Cordoba, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, La Pampa, Formosa, Chaco and Buenos Aires and the City of Buenos Aires, reaching grouping some 60 organizations. The cooperatives of FACTA belong to different industries and areas: textile, graphic, audiovisual, metallurgical, tourism, gastronomic, food production, shoemaking, construction, paintings, glass, between otros.[^69] During the first year intervened actively in conflicts of the meat-packing plant Incob (Bahía Blanca), the factory of food balanced for pets Huesitos Wilde and one tambera located in Punta Alta.[^70] Recently the Federation had large leadership in cases like that of the chain of restaurants recovered among those who are found The Chanchitos and Alé Alé, in the pizzeria The Casona or in the factory of tapas of empanadas and cakes The Litoraleña. In every case, the BAUEN served as a reference and, in many cases, as a meeting place and organization.

Years later, Federico Tonarelli, current president of FACTA, made a balance of the first decade of FACTA on the basis of the objectives listed by Resino in 2007:

[^68]: The conflict of the workers of the Casino of Buenos Aires was developed during the year 2007, the time of the above-mentioned declarations of Fabio Resino to the medium alternative Ágora TV.

[^69]: http://www.facta.org.ar/who-we are/

[^70]: http://www.revolutionvideo.org/agoratv/programs/empresasrecuperadas/factapresentacion.html

What said Fabio there is in effect absolutely. The organization by branches of worker cooperatives is what is more advanced, the rest costs more because depends on public policies that in some case, with its limitations, were, and in other no. We ideologically we have clear that it is necessary to dispute those funds of which the State has, product of the effort of all, the collections, taxes that pays the people. We have that very clear, what we should do is grow to such an extent that, from lo technical, legal, administrative and political, our businesses are strong enough to resist political changes, that the businesses them to work and them to work very well (…) we have the obligation to make them function and better than the businesses of capital.

FACTA, already in 2009, also participated in the foundation of a larger entity, of third degree, the National Confederation of Worker Cooperatives (CNCT), that nucleated an important number of federations of worker cooperatives of the whole country and today is one of the most important organizations of the cooperative sector. the bet a the formation of a confederation of this scope, that groups currently a close to hundred thousand worker-cooperative members through 36 federations of almost all of the provincias71, was one more step to try to overcome the historical dispersion that suffers self-managed work in Argentina. The CNCT worked during several years in floor 19 of the BAUEN, before moving on to have a headquarters own in the neighborhood port city of Balvanera.

### Resistance and solidarity continue

Throughout the following years, the legal case in which the judge of 1.a Instancia there was sentenced that the cooperative should have to evict the hotel, continued advancing in different levels of the Judicial Power, always with unfavorable result for workers. The appeal of the lawyers of the cooperative was granted by the judge and then rejected in second instance the 20 of May of 2008 by the National Chamber of Appeals for Commerce, Room C. In that presentation the Secretariat of Human Rights of the Nation, whose owner was Eduardo Luis Duhalde, had been presented as amicus curiae of the cooperative, but the camera confirmed, anyway, the original judgment.

[^71]: http://www.cnct.org.ar/sections/federations

This resolution of the Chamber was also appealed, but that instance rejected it the 16 August of the same year. Diego Carbone, the cooperative's lawyer, explains that then “what we do is interpose the resource extraordinary before the Supreme Court, but the Chamber of Appeals denies it saying that there's no Constitutional matter to appeal before the Court.” Starting from there, remained a resource of grievance before the Supreme Court of the Nation. The Court allowed some time to pass, until too rejected the resource and validated that way the judgment of Paula Hualde, the 5 July of 2011. “The Court says that was well that it was not granted the resource, that will not take it how Constitutional matter,” explains Carbone. “In that sense, obviously was a fatal blow, because we we understand that yes, that are colliding constitutional rights: the right to property against the right to work.” The lawyer adds that, in all that time, while the file was in the Court, Hualde lo had stopped, did not advance being able to having done it.

Starting from that moment, the cooperative was left with only the departure of the expropriation.

It did not stop, of course, of building their collective management every day, or of join support and social strength to their claims, while impelled new bills of expropriation in Congress. A fact notably significant in that search lo marked the act in which se distinguió a the Grandmothers of the Plaza of May with the name of the main auditorium of the hotel, the 17 April 2012. The bodies of Human Rights had supported permanently to the workers, participating in your mobilizations, showing solidarity, committing themselves in different ways. The cooperative recognized that support and added up the significant presence of the Grandmothers a their history.

The act of substitution of the name of the hall until that then known simply as Auditorium, a theater with 350 seats in the first story, had the presence of Estela of Carlotto and other members of the grouping. Meanwhile, the old cause of the BANADE was in review in the Ministry of Economy, and was hoped a intervention from the nation-State that alleviate the pressure on workers.

The act with the Grandmothers it wasn't done in that date because yes. Two days later, the 19 April 2012, was held a new mobilization al court of Paula Hualde, who had convened a hearing to put faced with faced with the cooperative and Mercoteles, trying or trying an agreement imposible.[^72] Having been rejected all resources until it reaches the máxi72 “A appointment with the judge about the case,” Página/12, 8 April 2012. Recovered from https://www.pagina12.com.ar/daily/elpais/1-191385-2012-04-08.html

ma instance judicial, the judge had again in their hands the file. All this, as might be expected, added tension to the daily work in the hotel. Assemblies were held and calls to the solidarity of sectors of self-management, guild and politicians, and the result was a large rally before court, in Marcelo T. of Alvear and Callao avenue, a few blocks from the BAUEN.

While the representatives of the cooperative, your lawyers and various legislators and political leaders and social that accompanied them rose a the hearing, the protesters they listened to diverse speakers. One of them was Omar Villablanca, leader of FASINPAT, Factory Without Bosses, the former Zanon Ceramics, other of the great examples of recovered businesses in the country. 

Come to these spaces, who are not our spaces, the courts (…) produces indignation (…). In these 10 years, we have not seen and we haven't heard walk these judged a no businessperson, or a the Solari, or a the Iurcoviches, or a the Zanons, or a those of Aurora Grundig or a those of Textiles… No businessperson walked these judged like us.

After a long meeting, Federico Tonarelli announced the meager result of the same:

A hearing extensive, a hearing long, a hearing hard, but if has stayed clear, both for the judge Hualde to the old employer, is that we're not ready to resign continuity of the cooperative, we're not ready to leave self-management, and we're no going to abandon the facilities of the hotel is which is the cadre that really determine peers.

In the meeting was not advanced because Hugo Iurcovich only had to offer the rendition of the cooperative in exchange for an uncertain promise of work, something that with their background, that the former workers knew well, was more than unlikely and even undesirable for those who had experienced self-management.

The judge did not decides to return to call the eviction in that moment, was conscious of the large support that had the cooperative. The question was (and is) who se encouraged commit such a injustice, how the eviction of a cooperative that gave work a 160 people, to benefit a businessperson of more than doubtful suitability, and confront the cost of make that decision.

The presentation of the criminal complaint by the defend general attached Roberto Gallardo against the Iurcovich group by the scam al BANADE and other irregularities present in this case took out, momentarily, a the judge from that imbroglio. Gallardo requested the nullification of the actions and, consequently, of the eviction, requesting that be expedited federal justice on the topic and that, meanwhile, commercial justice abstain of make decisions.

That complaint was finally archived, a year later, by the judge federal Casanello. Again the cause returned at the hands of Hualde, and return to begin. Meanwhile, the bills of expropriation were accumulated in Congress, but not managed to advance

### Workers of the BAUEN paid homage to the Grandmothers of the Plaza of May

Discourse of Federico Tonarelli the 18 April 2012*

> “We think simply that was the best opportunity to remind all of you, and a the grandmothers obviously, the story of this place. A place which is intimately linked to the story of Estela (of Carlotto), and the Grandmothers, from its beginning with the military dictatorship, when there's talk of the civilian members of the military dictatorship, this is perhaps, the case most visible case for all of us.

> The hotel constructed with public funds of the former BANADE, in times of the military dictatorship, by close relationship with the Armada, and from that very same moment, in the middle of World Cup of soccer in 1978, a hotel that was constituted in the hotel of sectors of power of the dominant class, by where passed each and every one of the activities of the most powerful sectors, even already in democracy of the '90s finished of raffle Argentina. And what we we hold with much pride, is that we have converted to this place, fairly in the place absolutely contrary to place that was for more than 25 years. And as we think accompany them until the end, until accomplish each one of the recovery of the identities of each one of the grandchildren who are missing, we think that the best way to honor them is call this auditorium so lovely “Grandmothers of Plaza of May,” and build together with you of here in the future an endless path, endless, so many thanks!”

### “No businessperson walked these judged like us”

Intervention of Omar Villablanca, representative of FASINPAT and of the Union of Ceramistas of Neuquén, in the doors of the court no. 9 the 19 April 2012*

We preferred call ourselves Zanon, because to that employer we les we have expropriated until the last name. We kept being Zanon under worker control, together with the peers of Cerámica Stefani and other factories of ceramic bricks that are going to fulfill two years of worker self-management. It seems to us a cites honorary be today with the peers of the BAUEN. The truth that we have walked these 10 years of struggle to hand, with our matches, with our differences, but understanding that what we've been defending is work. Real work, the work that we have created. 

The jobs that we have created and that have defended each of the peers the length and breadth of the country. After ten years, peers, seems to us there is no longer anything to demonstrate.

Worker management, the cooperatives are a concrete fact. They are a figure, a fact that has prospered and that we have demonstrated the workers who we have proved that not only can we defend our jobs, but that we have created jobs. We have created an economy which, today feeds more than 25 thousand peers throughout the country. The truth peers that come to these spaces, who are not our spaces, the courts, that don't have political independence, the truth that produces indignation, and that has to do with positions politicians not only of the Government of the City, but of all governments the length and breadth of the country. In these ten years, we have not seen and we haven't heard walk these judged a no businessperson, or a the Solari, or a the Iurcoviches, or a the Zanons, or a those of Aurora Grundig or a those of Textiles… no businessperson walked these judged. No businessperson has been burdened with a cause judicial like those that we have been burdened with workers. And then more than ten years ago, when we were walking the streets with the peers of Brukman, with the peers of the BAUEN, with the peers of Rebirth, with the peers of the textile factories, the word “expropriation” seemed bad word in this country. It seemed that didn't exist, we looked like crazy people that we came of 1.200 km to say the word here a Federal Capital. Today is tapa of the newspapers, end up of expropriate YPF, which is to say that isn't something that can't be made. We don't take a factory for self-exploitation. We don't take a factory or the businesses for walk judged. We take them to work!

To be dignified workers!

BAUEN belongs to the workers, and whoever doesn't like it, fuck them, fuck them!

## The long road to the expropriation

The 21 of March of 2014 marked another anniversary of the occupation of the hotel by their workers, the eleventh. Like every year, the cooperative had organized an event convoking numerous guests of different political sectors, guild and cooperative a show their support for self-management of the BAUEN. Even, was presented in that framework the report of the fourth survey of recovered businesses done by the Open Faculty Program of the UBA,[^73] in which was made a reading based on the survey that already was done from the year 2002 of the situation of the recovered businesses in the country.

That same day, coincidence or causality, arrived al hotel a new eviction notice sent by the Court no. 9 of Paula Hualde. An ominous shadow tinged the celebration: again the threat, danger. The symbolism of receive the news of a new eviction notice the day on which workers and many other organizations were celebrating the eleven years of the recovery of the BAUEN does not escape anyone, whether sought or not by the judge.

Everyone, hotel workers and who se solidarizaban, they started again the campaign for its defense. was reactivated the demand for the expropriation law in Congress, that by now already had four bills presented in the Chamber of Deputies that replaced to that of Francisco Gutiérrez when lost validity. Among these were counted that of Victoria Donda of Free of the South (that was joined the 4 of June of 2008, lost parliamentary status and was again proposed), that of Carlos Heller of the Solidarity Party (presented the 17 of December of 2012) and that of Héctor Recalde and Adriana Puiggrós, both of the Front for Victory (that present the theirs shortly after of the reactivation of the eviction). To these three must join a bill prior of Carlos Tinirello, that had been elected as Deputy by the list of Self-determination and Freedom, the party of Luis Zamora. Everyone went in the same line of the original of the “Barba” Gutiérrez, with some variations in each case. However, none of them was able to advance.

[^73]: Center of Documentation of Recovered Businesses, New recovered businesses 2010-2013, Bs. As.: Peña Lillo/Continent, series The Worker Economy, 2014.

The campaign against the eviction and for expropriation reached ribetes international. For May first was organized a day of international solidarity with the BAUEN, and arrived adherences from different parts of the world, but especially from the United States and countries of Latin America and Europe. Among them, of factories and recovered businesses how Fralib of France, Officine Zero and RiMaflow of Italy or VioMe of Greece, that in their plant still today has a sign hung up made for the occasion what do you say, in Castillian, that “half of our heart is in Buenos Aires: VioMe in solidarity with the BAUEN.”

Also at the local level proliferated demonstrations of support for the cooperative. Personalities how Osvaldo Bayer and Quino se pronunciaron, together with hundreds of political leaders and intellectuals. The days 15 and 16 of April was done in the BAUEN the Social and Political Book Fair, where were set up stands of independent publishers and self-managed, solidarity with the workers. The flag and the T-shirt of the BAUEN were seen in demonstrations, recitals, stadiums and even the players of the club of soccer Atlanta left for the court with the black t-shirt of the cooperative, posing before the party with a sign that he was saying “The BAUEN is everyone's.” This shocking series of activities culminated with a large festival in the doorway of the hotel, with a crowd that concurred to support to the workers and also a listen to musicians as the Berisso and Attack 77, that cheered the night of the 28 of May of 2014 and covered with people the whole block of the hotel on Callao avenue.

While, the Iurcoviches did not sit idly by. As never before, dedicated themselves to an intense propaganda campaign, that normally is not seen in most cases of recovered businesses. This included from posters around town until a web page (“The truth about the BAUEN”) and the considerable helps of some half, especially the newspaper *Clarín*. More and more openly, the multimedia took the side of the Iurcoviches.

A article of the 27 of March titled “The justice ordered to evict the BAUEN, occupied makes 11 years.” And a descent underscored that “the hotel would return to the hands of the business that controlled it until 2001.” While in the title denied the quality of recovered enterprise to talk directly of a hotel “occupied,” too abandoned any attempt at hide that the buyers and owners of the domain according to the judge, are really the same that bankrupted it in 2001. And explained that “in 1997 a Chilean group, Solari SA, bought the BAUEN, but broke in 2001 and transferred the hotel a Mercoteles, a company that, according to workers, is linked to the original owners.” As we have already seen, Solari did not transfer anything to Mercoteles, but a Bauen SA. And in rigor nor transferred nothing, but was a resolution of the judge Fabier Dubois which did so. Also *Clarín* takes charge of reflect the “willpower (of Mercoteles) of conserve jobs.” Therefore, affirmed that the business would contact to the workers to add them to the new stage.

Something noteworthy is the language used to explain bankruptcy of the hotel in private hands: was “dragged by the crisis.” After have titled “the crisis caused two new deaths,” on occasion of the murders of Darío Santillán and Maximiliano Kosteki in the Bridge Pueyrredón the 26 of June of 2002, the allusion is, at least, inconvenient. Especially because those who lo “dragged” are the ones that, at the time of finalize writing of this book, still want come back.

*Clarín* did not stop paying attention to the BAUEN. In fact is, probably and except a Página/12 from the opposite perspective, the newspaper that has paid the most attention to the recovered hotel. No thus a many others of the almost 400 recovered businesses. As the situation was not being resolved, the Iurcoviches, supported more and more openly by Clarín, increased the pressure. Also of the website, workers they found out by means of some deputies that the Iurcoviches were traveling the offices of the congress with a folder lobbying against the expropriation, and they tried to find interlocutors within the members of the cooperative to try split it from the inside. It goes without saying that failed unfortunately.

The newspaper *Clarín* published the 6 June a new and suggestive article on the case of the hotel, already without dissimulation openly favorable to the posture of the empresa74. Under a mantle of apparent impartiality repeats occasionally the arguments of the Iurcoviches (described right in the headline as “the owners”), and is careful to link the cooperative with the workers of the old business. For the newspaper, the hotel (repeat) broke “dragged by the crisis of 2001” and “wound up in the hands of a cooperative,” giving the impression that a group of people that had nothing to do with the hotel occupied it and they exploit it in its benefit (“a venture managed by some 130 employees that make up, as they present themselves, a worker cooperative that leads abbreviations of the venture hotelier”). The web of scam, fraud and stripping led by the current owners of the business Mercoteles (that claims ownership) and previous owners of Bauen SA does not appear in all the article, which terminates predicting that the eviction will be done in the form “peaceful and before the winter judicial recess.”

The final offensive arrived when the judge again set a date for the eviction, the 10 September. Once again, the newspaper titled that “time is up.” “Tension in the BAUEN,” complete the título75. This time, with declarations of Hugo Iurcovich in person, their “legitimate owner.” Iurcovich said that “Justice already refused exploitation in four opportunities, the hotel isn't enabled for its functioning, does not have expertise of any kind, does not pay a single tax and is outside of the Law” (with capital in the original). The cooperative, for its part, advised that weren't going to abandon your jobs. 

Despite the catastrophic headline, the term expired and there was not eviction.

### A Bauen of the State?

In November of 2014 transcended that the Deputy Andrés Larroque, of the Front for Victory, had presented or was about to present a new expropriation bill that was backed up, for the first time explicitly, by the Executive Power. Workers of the BAUEN, after the latter resolution adverse of the Supreme Court –that represented the definitive close of the possibilities of reconsideration of the judgment of first instance from the judicial–, had started efforts at the governmental level, of which emerged the reactivation of the study of the old debt of the Iurcoviches with the BANADE, that was in the setting of the Ministry of Economy.

The bill resulting varied substantially from the previous. Their foundations were similar and were anchored in bonds of the Iurcovich group with the dictatorship, credit and the debt unpaid with the BANADE and the lack of execution by the State. Next, the bill declared of public utility and subject to expropriation the property of Callao 360, whose severance the State would determine after deducting those debts. The change came through there, the proposal wasn't cede the expropriated goods a the BAUEN cooperative, but create a Society of the State that would administer the hotel to receive passengers of social programs and health, which is to say, would turn into a hotel social belonging al Nation-state. The members of the cooperative would become workers of the State business resulting from the law. It was not clear, in those transcended, which would be the fate of the cooperative, since in some cases it was argued that was going to continue existing and would take care of some tasks and efforts within the hotel, as a member of the State.

The bill of Larroque, one of the more leaders of the grouping kirchnerista The Cámpora, caused indignation among the conservative media, that added to traditional bitterness against the BAUEN cooperative their obsession with the “camporismo.” The newspaper *La Nación* published the news in shocked tones: “The Cámpora now wants expropriate the hotel Bauen”76. The newspaper pointed out that that happened “despite the failures judicial validated by the Court that orders return it to their legitimate owner.” After describe the principle characteristics of the bill, quoting their text in a couple of paragraphs, and explain that use that se le destinaría al hotel was “the provision of social tourism and of coverage a the derivations medical of the whole country, made through the PAMI,” the conservative daily paper ended quoting to the agent of Mercoteles, Gerardo Palomero, who did nothing more than repeat the well-known arguments of the business. 

In spite of that was a bill that moved away of the line of self-management that characterized from its beginning a the recovery of the BAUEN, the cooperative did not have many others departures and decided to accept that idea. Subtract see the role of the cooperative organization, that workers were not ready to abandon, even if changed the legal status and owner and become State workers, with stable jobs, agreement and guaranteed salaries. The bill of Larroque too posed, it should be highlighted, an issue worthy of being debated on the social role of a company in the hotel business, is cooperative or state.

However, and although se lo gave how safe, the expropriation and nationalization of the BAUEN was not produced. The bill did not advance, went postponing in a year 2015 extremely shaken and convulsed. The death of fiscal Nisman marked the beginning of the year and had a serious impact on politics, to go right into the debates pre-election and, little by little, the country went sliding to a debate large-scale between two models of country. The neoliberal threat represented by the Presidential candidacy of Macri was growing and pushing away the topics that did not belong to what was seen as the “big politics.” The elections were looming and nationalization of the BAUEN was postponing until, finally, was forgotten. However, Larroque's bill wasn't at all discarded, and some of your clauses were reused in the expropriation bill that finally was al recinto to be voted in the last session of the year.

### Expropriation against the clock

It's still paradoxical that a bill driven, worked and desired by the workers for almost ten years would be approved in a race against time. The result the Presidential elections in 2015 was the disparo of started of this last opportunity to try to approve the expropriation before the triumph of a political option openly hostile, that had already closed the expropriation in the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires and with obvious political relationships and perhaps economic with the Iurcoviches, block it decisively.

The cooperative workers insisted, as they had for years, in their visits to the Congress to try that vote the law before the change of composition of the cameras. This time was a remarkable result. For vote the bill, taking as a basis the presented by the deputies Carlos Heller and Juan Carlos June, of the PSOL, were united in a single text the proposals presented in different moments by deputies of a number of blocks. The final bill has contributions from the mentioned and also of Victoria Donda, Adriana Puiggrós, Héctor Recalde and Andrés Larroque, authors of the other versions.

This bill unified entered within the package of 90 laws that started to a voting in the last session before the Presidential change. The half hegemonic and the partisan from the government by assume subtracted the quorum, arguing that laws should not be voted on until was the new composition of the Congress, after the 10 of December. To media campaign and in social networks ferocious was unleashed. Among the laws questioned, was the of the BAUEN.

Of course, *Clarín* did not deny himself a new flood against workers. “It advances a bill to expropriate the BAUEN and there is claims,” published the 26 of November of 2015[^77], the day on which was held the session. For *La Nación*, it was a session “scandalous,” on which it was voted that a very diverse package of laws. Of all those laws, a La Nación, Clarín and to the PRO, in mouth of the then Deputy Federico Pinedo, which more bothered was the of the BAUEN. And for good reason, after thirteen years of fight against the powers that this coalition half-politics defends. They highlighted, for example, that the session was possible because “eight deputies of the Left” gave the quorum. The deputies in question belonged to sectors heterogeneous, of the center-left and left, and the main motive for their presence in the recinto was, fairly, vote the expropriation of the BAUEN, as had asked them, one by one, workers.

That legitimacy of the hotel of the workers is what bothered. *Clarín* echoed too of an publisher of Mercoteles, “owner of the hotel of Callao 360.” However, little and nothing it was said of the bill and of what meant its approval for workers. This aspect yes reflected it medium self-managed Lavaca, which remains from the beginning the avatars of the recovered businesses and, especially, of the BAUEN. The article of Lavaca reflects the tension, uncertainty and the emotion of the day:

Arminda Palacios tells that is about to turn 80 years old, but does not say that is the most veteran. ‘I don't like: yes I say that I'm the oldest’. ‘Today is the day that we deserve the workers --> so that to give us our workplace. Accompanied by my companions me I feel strongest. I have great hope. My dream is that the BAUEN stay in the hands of the workers. All the years I say the same thing and already me is heavy, but I'm going to be until the ultimate consequences.

And so was, hope was becoming reality on a long afternoon on which quorum was not reached and workers encouraged from the tribunes a the legislators that sat in their benches and booed to which were leaving, in a sort of dance of the chairs that was prolonged and no se arrived al number of 129 deputies necessary for the session to begin. continues Lavaca:

> When the marker changed of color (of rojo a green) for indicate that the Chamber can sesionar the boxes break in applause. But the counter followed playing: 128, 127, 128, 126, 125, 127, 128. “Tie them!,” proposes someone from the tribunes.

Finally appeared a Deputy of Tucumán and arrived al quorum. Immediately, were voted on all the laws in a single bloc and were approved.

The deputies started to leave, but in the tribunes cooperators had not yet understood what was happening. A seña of Carlos Heller a Federico Tonarelli unleashed the celebration.

The BAUEN had at last half sanction of the Chamber of Deputies of the Nation for its expropriation.

### The text

The unified bill incorporated elements of their prior versions and combined them into a single text. Outside of formalities of rigor, the substantive points of of the bill that the following year the Senate I would convert in the Law 27344 and the president Macri would veto shortly after are the following:

Art. first) is declared of public utility and subject to expropriation the properties and all the facilities that make up the building of the Hotel Bauen (…).

Art. 2°) is declared of public utility and subject to expropriation all the goods furniture e immaterial, included brands and patents, that have relationship with tourist use, social and community that is developed in the property (…), with exclusion from those that would have been acquired (…) by the cooperative (…).

Art. 3°) For the purposes of the severance corresponding (…) the valuation will be determined on the basis of the general state of the expropriated goods (…) al 20 of March of 2003.

It is nodal the article that describes how will calculate the severance and the amount that finally would correspond pay to the State for expropriation, because has relationship with the history of the business of the Iurcoviches, makes justice on the situation of origin and denies the myth, propagated by the macrismo and the bosses, that expropriate the BAUEN “is much money.”

Art. 4°) The sum that eventually must be fertilized in fulfillment of the expropriation process will be cancelled total or partly, according to the corresponding tasación, with the credits that the national State posseses against the owner and/or the owners of the goods declared of public utility and subject to expropriation, affected al regime of the right real of mortgage, in virtue of the loans contracted opportunely with the former National Bank of Development (BANADE), thus as with any other debt exigible (…) against the owners of the goods whatever its origin.

In other words, the law anticipates pay the mandatory severance to execute the expropriation with the debts that the Iurcoviches have with the State, principally, but not exclusively, with the BANADE, once they can be determined. The supposed $30 million that must be paid and that the half favorable to the bosses wielded, are not in the body of the law.

In the rest of the articulate, is ceded what has been expropriated in loan to the cooperative Buenos Aires A National Business “for the achievement of their social objective, with the condition of continue the cultural activities, educational and social that develops.” The cooperative too “must destine and create spaces of cultural advancement” and for the “development of practices educational labor that allow learning about trades related to the hospitality.”

The imprint of Larroque's bill is noted in the article 7°, what do you say that the cooperative will allocate “at least the 30% of the plazas available to provide coverage a passengers of the social tourism and (…) a the derivations medical of the whole country.” Finally, gives warning to the judge Hualde so that stop the process of eviction.

It is clear, in this last part, that neither is it true that the expropriation only benefits a few. Never was thus, because in the hotel work 130 cooperators, but above all because the BAUEN, as a recovered business, always developed tasks like those that are said in the bill, who are not a legal obligation, how could think of a reader displicente, but a recognition to what already was built so that, as says the slogan, the BAUEN is of all.

But the law was vetoed and the later ephemeral president, Federico Pinedo, declared that, of all the laws voted, the one he feared most is the of the BAUEN. says *La Nación* that the expropriation, “for Pinedo means ‘give him an enormous amount of money a a small group of people, take away money that could go a people who can have basic needs of food so that 40 people has a hotel in Callao and Corrientes.’”[^78]

To this height of this text, Pinedo refutes only.

### By way of a provisional epilogue

And in case it was not entirely clear who is who in this story, *La Nación* contributes to put white on black. The judge Hualde sent again in March a eviction notice, with a deadline of 14 of April.

Since it was Good Friday, off, sent then a rectification and the date stayed the 19 of April. Macri already had vetoed the expropriation after Christmas.

With the letters echadas and the cooperative ready to fight for your rights as throughout their whole history, the newspaper *La Nación* published on Tuesday 14 of March a virulent publisher against businesses recovered by workers and, especially, against the BAUEN hotel. The purpose of the daily is transparent: pressure so that Congress not reject the veto and the judge Do not doubt in carry out the eviction. That pressure is becoming a methodology of the press addicted to the government and a fraudulent businesses. Jorge Lanata did something similar when had approved (unanimously) the expropriation of the factory Petinari in the legislature from the province of Buenos Aires, making an interview extremely friendly a the former owners (that should $60 million in salaries) that asked the governor María Eugenia Vidal veto the law. The law was vetoed and workers were evicted for a mega-operative police of 600 effective the 3 of March. Today are camping in the front of the factory, that had achieved reactivate how the cooperative Gathered of the West. That sequence seek for the BAUEN.

It's not, logically, the first time that the newspaper of the Mitre editorializes against the recovered businesses. They are starts of bosses indignant against the dare of this experience of self-management that defends jobs and the productive infrastructure that would be irretrievably lost (which is news every day for a year and a half) if, fairly, workers did not occupy your places of work to be able preserve them of the voracity of businesspeople that destroying assets and lead to the businesses a bankruptcy intentionally and fraudulently. They do it because know that, in the name of legality, hurts them the enormous legitimacy that have the workers that defend their possibility of have a job and a living wage, forming cooperative businesses that are more human and, when have the necessary tools, more efficient because no seek maximum benefit for its owner but well-being collective.

*La Nación* gets upset by the lack of respect for private property that would represent “illegal occupations” when se violates private property to defend others constitutional rights how the right to work, a housing, a education, a life worthy. Never gets upset, instead, when is attacked public property. They are not indignant about the multiplication of the debt, by the destruction of jobs or by the closure of thousands of factories, or were outraged when Martínez of Hoz and Cavallo destroyed the heritage public and nationalized external debt private or when Sturzenegger weapon a gigantic bicycle financial from the Central Bank, at the expense of the State, like always.

It is logical that do not be indignant because are part of that looting. No from now, when accumulated a debt of more than 300 million pesos to the State, but right from their beginning, when were born as the newspaper of the oligarchy in the times on which was consolidated the State liberal with two genocides, that of the Paraguay and that of original peoples of the Pampa and Patagonia, in which se “occupied illegally” thousands of square kilometers of the richest lands in the country. It would be interesting that, when say that “our country isn't a good example of the respect for property” look their own history.

The indignation of *La Nación* against the “illegal occupations” has a addressee direct, workers of the BAUEN cooperative. They present the deceased businessperson Marcelo Iurcovich and a their son Hugo, without name them, as poor victims of the new barbarians, the workers that occupy businesses (prefer call them employees, to highlight their subordination a an employment contract, that really they violated employers).

They overlook the fact of have constructed the hotel with a credit unpaid of the BANADE thanks to your links with the military dictatorship and that his breaks left some 70 families on the street. They affirm that the use of the initial B.To.U.E.N. by the cooperative infringes on patent laws, when the businesspeople that are defending changed the registered name a few times to evade taxes and payments, and the last manuever they did it with the phantom enterprise Mercoteles, to which the judge attributes to him the ownership of hotel.

They call the immediate eviction because if not “the fact accomplished” is imposed faced with property. But not demand that se acts before fact accomplished of the asset-stripping that leaves people without work. Neither faced with the fraudulent maneuvers of the businesspeople that take credit that do not pay (preferentially in public banks), that do not pay social expenses of their workers (by which these reach retirement age, having worked decades, and don't have contributions registered), that do not pay taxes and leave a debt millionaire before the AFIP, an enormous pagadios that really pays it the Argentine people.

Ignore the reform of the bankruptcy law. They do not know not even the background in such meaning in the “countries serious” that they admire, like in own United States, France, Spain or Italy, that possesses a specific law, the law Marcora, so that bankrupt businesses come to be managed by the cooperatives of their workers with financial support of the State. Or that one of the main candidates for the Presidency of the United States in the last elections and today, according to the surveys, a politician still more popular than the president Trump, Bernie Sanders, pose the formation of cooperatives in bankrupt businesses how as the main means to recover the indexes employment that country.

Nor seem know that was a reform of the bankruptcy law in 2011 that benefits the business recovery by the workers. With all its deficiencies (between them that leaves much discretionality a judges to decide use the mechanism or not and prolongs the times well above of the ability to hopes of workers who end up losing their source of income), *La Nación* decides ignore its existence. happens that in the head simplifying of the neoliberal the businesses are like living beings, that are born, grow, age and die (and some reproduced al infinite, how the group Macri), and the bankruptcy law is what regulates what is made with the goods of the died. But this false deceased, the businessperson vaciador, sold everything to a front man and le left your employees a comb spent and some shoes old. And in the case of Bauen SACIC, nothing.

The occupancy of factories and businesses is one of the few tools of struggle that have workers to defend their right to work when employers abandon your responsibilities. It is illegal business fraud. It is illegal leave people without means of subsistence to make a financial deal, real estate or simply to get rid of without cost of the assets of the business. The BAUEN cooperative isn't illegal, among other things because the National Congress recognized it through a law that, although the president has vetoed it, is still in legislative process because the parliament has the faculty to approve or reject the veto. And is, just like the struggle to all the workers of the recovered businesses (and to recover) legitimate in the eyes of the Argentine people.
